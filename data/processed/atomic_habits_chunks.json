As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands\nand came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have\nno memory of the moment of impact.\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a\ndistorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into\nthe inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged throughout my\nhead. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and\ntwo shattered eye sockets.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help.\nI looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates\ntook the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of\nblood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of\nhow seriously I had been injured.\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to\nthe nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random\nhands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked\nslowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.\n“What year is it?”\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.\n“What is your mom’s name?”\n“Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.\n“Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to\nremember my own mother’s name.\nThat is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid\nswelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.\nMinutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic\nfunctions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I",

      "content": "stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen,\nthey also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and\nordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.\nI was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across\nthe street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me\nalong while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had\narrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside\nme. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my\nhand during the flight.\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home to\ncheck on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked back\ntears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation\nceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he\ndrove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly\ntwenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into the\ntrauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I\nwas having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be\nfixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—\nmy third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a\nventilator.\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had\nentered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with\nleukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old.\nAfter two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone\nmarrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy,\nhealthy, and cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents\nfound themselves back in the same place with a different child.\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to\ncomfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade\nearlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents slept\nrestlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue,\nthe next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later,\n“It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”\nMY RECOVERY\n\nMercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where\nthe doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I finally\nregained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to smell. As a test,\na nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff an apple juice box. My sense of\nsmell returned, but—to everyone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced\nair through the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My\neyeball bulged out of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the\noptic nerve attaching my eye to my brain.\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place as the\nair seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was scheduled\nfor surgery one week later, which would allow me some additional time to heal.\nI looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing match, but I was cleared\nto leave the hospital. I returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial\nfractures, and a bulging left eye.\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on\npause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see straight. It took\nmore than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location.\nBetween the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months before I could\ndrive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like\nwalking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but\nthere were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and overwhelmed.\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the\nbaseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part of my life.\nMy dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had a\ndream of playing professionally, too. After months of rehabilitation, what I\nwanted more than anything was to get back on the field.\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled around, I\nwas the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was sent down to\nplay with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing since age four,\nand for someone who had spent so much time and effort on the sport, getting cut\nwas humiliating. I vividly remember the day it happened. I sat in my car and\ncried as I flipped through the radio, desperately searching for a song that would\nmake me feel better.\nAfter a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a senior, but\nI rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven innings of high school\nvarsity baseball, barely more than a single game.",

      "content": "injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new beginning, and\nit was the place where I would discover the surprising power of small habits for\nthe first time.\nHOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\nAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot on\nthe baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the roster as a freshman, I\nwas thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had managed to\nbecome a college athlete.\nI wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused\non getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video\ngames, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy\nworld of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These\nimprovements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I\nstarted to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the\nclassroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s\nduring my first year.\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many\ncases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but\nconsistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me\nwhen I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a habit to lift\nweights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-foot-\nfour-inch frame bulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the pitching\nstaff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the end of the season, I\nwas selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior season\nthat my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to\npay off.\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the\nhospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at\nDenison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an\nhonor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I\ngraduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories.\nThat same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the\nPresident’s Medal.\nI hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there was\nnothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never ended up playing\n\nprofessionally. However, looking back on those years, I believe I accomplished\nsomething just as rare: I fulfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this\nbook can help you fulfill your potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience\ntaught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will\ncompound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.\nWe all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often\ndepends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with\nthe same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.\nMaybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I don’t\nknow any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining\nmoment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic All-\nAmerican; there were many. It was a gradual evolution, a long series of small\nwins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only choice I\nhad—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later\nwhen I started my own business and began working on this book.\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For years, I\nhad been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits and I was\nfinally ready to share some of them publicly. I began by publishing a new article\nevery Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led\nto my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number\nhad grown to more than thirty thousand people.\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers,\nwhich made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt\nlike an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was\nbecoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also\nfelt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a master of the topic, but\nrather someone who was experimenting alongside my readers.\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book\ndeal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading\nnow. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly\nasked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior\nchange, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote\nspeeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications like Time,",

      "content": "Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read by over eight million\npeople that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began reading my work\nand sharing it with their teams.\nAt the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became the\npremier training platform for organizations and individuals interested in building\nbetter habits in life and work.* Fortune 500 companies and growing start-ups\nbegan to enroll their leaders and train their staff. In total, over ten thousand\nleaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits\nAcademy, and my work with them has taught me an incredible amount about\nwhat it takes to make habits work in the real world.\nAs I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com is\nreceiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred thousand people\nsubscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far beyond my\nexpectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think of it.\nHOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU\nThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book,\nyou must first become the book.” I originally learned about the ideas mentioned\nhere because I had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to rebound from my\ninjury, to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high level on the field, to\nbecome a writer, to build a successful business, and simply to develop into a\nresponsible adult. Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you\npicked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.\nIn the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building better\nhabits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science supports\neverything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research paper; it’s an\noperating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical advice front and center as I\nexplain the science of how to create and change your habits in a way that is easy\nto understand and apply.\nThe fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and\nmore—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the\nbest ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most\ncompelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I hope, is\nto find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly\nactionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts\nwho preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.\nThe backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving,\n\nresponse, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of\nthese steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these\nterms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus,\nresponse, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more\nrecently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward\nor punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s\nmodel did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our\nhabits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs\nimpact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In\nrecent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these\npages.\nIn total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and\nbehavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to\naccurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal\nemotions on our habits. While some of the language may be familiar, I am\nconfident that the details—and the applications of the Four Laws of Behavior\nChange—will offer a new way to think about your habits.\nHuman behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to\nmoment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s\nabout the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can rely\non year after year. The ideas you can build a business around, build a family\naround, build a life around.\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the\nbest way I know—an approach that will be effective regardless of where you\nstart or what you’re trying to change. The strategies I cover will be relevant to\nanyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement, whether your goals\ncenter on health, money, productivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long\nas human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.\n\n\nTHE \nFUNDAMENTALS\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference",

      "content": "THE \nFUNDAMENTALS\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference\n\n\n1\nThe Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\nTHE FATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The organization, which was\nthe governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired\nDave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional\ncyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity.\nSince 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic\nGames, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de\nFrance. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one\nof the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because\nthey were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using\ntheir gear.\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What\nmade him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a\nstrategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the\nphilosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.\nBrailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down\neverything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by\n1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might\nexpect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make\nthem more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They\nasked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle\ntemperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each\nathlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a\nwind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which\nproved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.\nBut they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent\n\nimprovements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested different types\nof massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery. They hired a\nsurgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the\nchances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that\nled to the best night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the\nteam truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally\nslip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results\ncame faster than anyone could have imagined.\nJust five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated\nthe road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where\nthey won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years\nlater, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they\nset nine Olympic records and seven world records.\nThat same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the\nTour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he\nwould go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five\nTour de France victories in six years.\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world\nchampionships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured\nfive Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful\nrun in cycling history.*\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes\ntransform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would\nseem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements\naccumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this\napproach in your own life?\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and\nunderestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too\noften, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.\nWhether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a\nchampionship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to\nmake some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.\nMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it\nisn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long",

      "content": "you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym\nthree days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour\ntonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the\nresults never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous\nroutines.\nUnfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad\nhabit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If\nyou work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you\nprocrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time\nto finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor\ndecisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small\nchoices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a\n1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of\nshifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying\nfrom Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the\nheading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of\nNew York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the\nairplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United\nStates, you end up hundreds of miles apart.*\nSimilarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very\ndifferent destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse\nseems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a\nlifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who\nyou could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime\ntransformations.\nThat said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now.\nWhat matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.\nYou should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your\ncurrent results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each\nmonth, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s\nnot going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every\nmonth, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re\nmoving slower than you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a\nlagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of\n\nrepeat.\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow\nthe curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will\ncompound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you\nearn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading\nbooks and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones\nthat will define your future self.\nTime magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply\nwhatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time\nyour enemy.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily\nas good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is\ncrucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your\nliking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU\nPositive Compounding\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but it counts for a lot over an entire career. The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new\nskill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches\nyou something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a\nnetwork of broad and strong connections over time.\nNegative Compounding\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these\ncommon causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The\nsame is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.",

A one-degree shift,\nseemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a\nhuge change.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which\nbuild up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up\neverywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over\nthe body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it\nbuilds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the\nair within six weeks.\nSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical\nthreshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages\nof any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make\nprogress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem\nduring the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going\nanywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful\noutcomes are delayed.\nThis is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last.\nPeople make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop.\nYou think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any\nchange in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good\nhabits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits\nneed to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the\nPlateau of Latent Potential.\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is\nnot because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have\nnot yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving\nsuccess despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting\nwhen you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not\nwasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.\nWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will\ncall it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most dramatic event\nrather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago\n—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump\ntoday possible.\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can\ngrind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all\n\nthe while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion\nthey have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts.\nChange can take years—before it happens all at once.\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful\nteams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in\ntheir locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter\nhammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a\ncrack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I\nknow it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.”\nTHE PLATEAU OF LATENT POTENTIAL\nFIGURE 2: We often expect progress to be linear. At the very least, we hope it will come quickly. In reality, the results of our efforts are often delayed. It is not until months or years later\nthat we realize the true value of the previous work we have done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel discouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work\nwithout experiencing any results. However, this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is not until much later that the full value of previous efforts is revealed.\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a\nsingle, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows\nstronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a\nbad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the task of building a\ngood habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.\nBut what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to survive the\nPlateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side? What is it that",

      "content": "causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables others to enjoy the\ncompounding effects of good ones?\nFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nPrevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—\ngetting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and\nworrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific,\nactionable goals.\nFor many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was a\ngoal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the\nweights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I\nsucceeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize\nthat my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to\ndo with the systems I followed.\nWhat’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I first\nlearned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert comic. Goals are\nabout the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead\nto those results.\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your\nsystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches,\nand conduct practice.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar\nbusiness. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees,\nand run marketing campaigns.\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your\nsystem is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle\ndifficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your\ninstructor.\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and\nfocused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were\na basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and\nfocused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get\nresults?\nI think you would.\n\nThe goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous\nto spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win\nis to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill\nWalsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If\nyou want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system\ninstead.\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals\nare good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A\nhandful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your\ngoals and not enough time designing your systems.\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on\nthe people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that\nambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had\nthe same objective but didn’t succeed.\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the\njob. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the\ngoal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t the goal\nof winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the\nsport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like\nevery other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when\nthey implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved\na different outcome.\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon\nthe energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you\nmaintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first\nplace, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst\nof motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed\nthe system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.\nAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the\ncounterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our\nresults, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are\nthe systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results",

      "content": "level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need\nto solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix\nthemselves.\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll\nbe happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually\nputting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many\ntimes I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future\nself to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or\nafter my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax.\nFurthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal\nand are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box\nyourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that\nyour actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when\nyou set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when\nthere are many paths to success.\nA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the\nprocess rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself\npermission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.\nAnd a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you\nfirst envision.\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work\nhard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The\nrace is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused\non a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is\nwhy many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after\naccomplishing a goal.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building\nsystems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less\nthinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of\nendless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your\ncommitment to the process that will determine your progress.\n\nA SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The\nproblem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not\nbecause you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for\nchange.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\nsystems.\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core\nthemes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word\natomic. By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny\nchange, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just\nany old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger\nsystem. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the\nbuilding blocks of remarkable results.\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that\ncontributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem\ninsignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that\nmultiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They\nare both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a\nregular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the\nsource of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nHabits are the compound interest of selfimprovement. Getting 1\npercent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against\nyou, which is why understanding the details is essential.\nSmall changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a\ncritical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding\nprocess are delayed. You need to be patient.\nAn atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as\natoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the\nbuilding blocks of remarkable results.\nIf you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on\nyour system instead.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\nsystems.",

      "content": "FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.\nThe first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with\nchanging your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a\nchampionship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change.\nThe second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with\nchanging your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,\ndecluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice.\nMost of the habits you build are associated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is\nconcerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your\njudgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and\nbiases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is\nabout what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last—when it\ncomes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—the problem is not that\none level is “better” or “worse” than another. All levels of change are useful in\ntheir own way. The problem is the direction of change.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what\nthey want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to\nbuild identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we\nwish to become.\n\n\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY-BASED HABITS\n\n\nFIGURE 4: With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first\nperson says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable\nresponse, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying\naround the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a\nsmall difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. Smoking was part\nof their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify as someone\nwho smokes.\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to\nimprove. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this\ndiet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they\n\nshould take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their\nactions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize\nthat their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a\ndemocracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social equality.\nThe system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like absolute\nauthority and strict obedience. You can imagine many ways to try to get more\npeople to vote in a democracy, but such behavior change would never get off the\nground in a dictatorship. That’s not the identity of the system. Voting is a\nbehavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations,\nor societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that shape the system, an\nidentity behind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more\nmoney, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then\nyou’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. You may want\nbetter health, but if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment,\nyou’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if\nyou never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have\na new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a\ngood example. “For as long as I can remember, I’ve chewed my fingernails,”\nClark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was young, and then\nmorphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved to stop\nchewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful willpower alone, I\nmanaged to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My thought\nwas that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’t chew them. And it\nworked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made\nmy fingers look really nice for the first time. The manicurist even said that—\nother than the chewing—I had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was\nproud of my fingernails. And even though that’s something I had never aspired\nto, it made all the difference. I’ve never chewed my nails since; not even a single\nclose call. And it’s because I now take pride in properly caring for them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your",

      "content": "motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud\nof how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain\nit. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an\nupper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more\nlikely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll\nfight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of\nmotivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of\nyour identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy\nonce or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard\nto stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they\nbecome part of who you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a\nmusician.\nYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an\nindication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or\nnonconsciously.* Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular\naspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.\nFor example, people who identified as “being a voter” were more likely to vote\nthan those who simply claimed “voting” was an action they wanted to perform.\nSimilarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn’t have\nto convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when\nyour behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing\nbehavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already\nbelieve yourself to be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When\nworking for you, identity change can be a powerful force for selfimprovement.\nWhen working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you\nhave adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your\nability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly\nfollowing the norms attached to their identity.\n\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology.”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into\nthese mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist\ncertain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to\nmaintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your\nbeliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.\nThe more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult\nit is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes\n(group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even\nif it’s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual,\nteam, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if\nthey conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.\nOn any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy\nor too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run,\nhowever, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets\nin the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your\nidentity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself\nrequires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your\nidentity.\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview play\nsuch an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first\nplace? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new\naspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder\nyou?\nTHE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs.\nEvery belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through\nexperience.*",

      "content": "More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you\nmake your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When\nyou write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you\ntrain each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.\nThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity\nassociated with that behavior. In fact, the word identity was originally derived\nfrom the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which\nmeans repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”\nWhatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have\nproof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have\nevidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night,\nyou have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s\nsnowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more\nevidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’t consider myself a writer. If you were to ask\nany of my high school teachers or college professors, they would tell you I was\nan average writer at best: certainly not a standout. When I began my writing\ncareer, I published a new article every Monday and Thursday for the first few\nyears. As the evidence grew, so did my identity as a writer. I didn’t start out as a\nwriter. I became one through my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your identity, but\nby virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones. Each\nexperience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider\nyourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you\nscribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence\naccumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off\nexperiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with\ntime, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your\nidentity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of\nbecoming yourself.\nThis is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and\ndeciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by\nhabit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you finish a\nbook, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If you go to the\ngym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes exercise. If you practice\n\nevidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does\nnot require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by\nproviding evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually\nis big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.\nPutting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your\nidentity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you\ndo.\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer.\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more\nimportant: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish\nthese things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the\nstory you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to perform a\nbad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be\nperfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both sides. You don’t\nneed a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a majority. It doesn’t\nmatter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an unproductive habit. Your\ngoal is simply to win the majority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes\nyou’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If\nnothing changes, nothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. \nDecide the type of person you want to be.\n2. \nProve it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as\na team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are\nyour principles and values? Who do you wish to become?\nThese are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but\nthey do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less",

Now your focus shifts from\nwriting a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent\nand reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy\nthey need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin\ntaking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost\nover 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day\nlong, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or\ntake a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she\nacted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that\nperson. She was right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key\ntheme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your\nidentity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a\nfeedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s\nimportant to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than\nyour results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not\ngetting a particular outcome.\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER\nIdentity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of this book\nwill provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build better habits in\nyourself, your family, your team, your company, and anywhere else you wish.\n\nBut the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to\nbecome?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you\nwant to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And\nthat’s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not\nset in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity\nyou want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us\nto the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter.\nBuilding better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not\nabout flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or\nwearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about achieving external measures of\nsuccess like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can\nhelp you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having\nsomething. They are about becoming someone.\nUltimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of\nperson you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your\ndeepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and\nidentity change.\nThe most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what\nyou want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the\ntype of person you wish to become.\nBecoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously\nedit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nThe real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better\nresults (although they can do that), but because they can change your\nbeliefs about yourself.",

      "content": "3\nHow to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\nIN 1898, A psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that\nwould lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules\nthat guide our behavior. Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of\nanimals, and he started by working with cats.\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was\ndesigned so that the cat could escape through a door “by some simple act, such\nas pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform.” For\nexample, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on\nthe side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and\nrun over to a bowl of food.\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They\nwould poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through openings, and\nclaw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the cats would happen\nto press the magical lever, the door would open, and they would escape.\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the\nbeginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the\nlever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.\nGradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the\nreward of escaping the box and getting to the food.\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual\nthat the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted,\n“Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90\nseconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\nDuring the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.\nDuring the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With\npractice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more\nautomatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to\n\nthe solution.\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating,\n“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those\nthat produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” His work\nprovides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own\nlives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are\nhabits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?\nWHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.\nThe process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you\nencounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I\nrespond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how\nto solve it. Like Thorndike’s cat, you’re just trying things out to see what works.\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully\nanalyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. You’re\ntaking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is\nbusy learning the most effective course of action.\nOccasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution.\nYou’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down.\nYou’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing\nvideo games relaxes you. You’re exploring, exploring, exploring, and then—\nBAM—a reward.\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next\ntime. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the events that preceded the\nreward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right before that?\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try\ndifferently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful\nactions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming.\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the\nprocess of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that\nsolve the problems and stresses you face regularly. As behavioral scientist Jason\nHreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our\nenvironment.”\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases. You learn to\nlock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything else. When a\nsimilar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to look for. There is",

These\ncognitive scripts can be followed automatically whenever the situation is\nappropriate. Now, whenever you feel stressed, you get the itch to run. As soon as\nyou walk in the door from work, you grab the video game controller. A choice\nthat once required effort is now automatic. A habit has been created.\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just\na memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.\nWhenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and\nautomatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain remembers\nthe past is to better predict what will work in the future.\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the\nbottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a\nresult, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for\nwhatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to\npawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely\nwhat happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up\nmental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nDespite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits.\nThe argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t want to\npigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much routine take\naway the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up a false\ndichotomy. They make you think that you have to choose between building\nhabits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.\nHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t\nhave their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.\nWithout good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar.\nWithout good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without\ngood learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve. If you’re\nalways being forced to make decisions about simple tasks—when should I work\nout, where do I go to write, when do I pay the bills—then you have less time for\nfreedom. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create\nthe mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.\nConversely, when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are\nhandled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the\n\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue,\ncraving, response, and reward.* Breaking it down into these fundamental parts\ncan help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.\nFIGURE 5: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nThis four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs\nthrough these steps in the same order each time.\nFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a\nbit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors were paying\nattention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water,\nand sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary\nrewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and\nfriendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also\nindirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper\nmotive behind everything we do.)\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment\nfor hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that\nwe’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.\nCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every\nhabit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—\nwe have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in\nstate it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of\nrelief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the\nfeeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to\nbe entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.\nThis is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.\nCravings differ from person to person. In theory, any piece of information\ncould trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not motivated by the same\ncues. For a gambler, the sound of slot machines can be a potent trigger that",

      "content": "sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who rarely gambles, the jingles\nand chimes of the casino are just background noise. Cues are meaningless until\nthey are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are\nwhat transform a cue into a craving.\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform,\nwhich can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs\ndepends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the\nbehavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you\nare willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your\nability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing\nit. If you want to dunk a basketball but can’t jump high enough to reach the\nhoop, well, you’re out of luck.\nFinally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every\nhabit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the\nreward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because\nthey serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.\nThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide\nbenefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive.\nGetting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves\nyour health and your dating prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that\nrewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least\nfor a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\nYour brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous\nsystem is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver\npleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback\nmechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones.\nRewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a\nhabit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and\nyou won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and\nyou won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then\nyou’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a\nbehavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.\nTHE HABIT LOOP\n\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four stages of cue,\ncraving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each day. But\nbefore we do that, we need to transform these four steps into a practical\nframework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate bad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it\nprovides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.\nYou can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior. When the\nlevers are in the right positions, creating good habits is effortless. When they are\nin the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\nHow to Create a Good Habit\nThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.\nThe 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.\nThe 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.\nThe 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\nHow to Break a Bad Habit\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.\nInversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an\nexhaustive framework for changing any human behavior, but I think they’re\nclose. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change apply to nearly\nevery field, from sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to management.\nThese laws can be used no matter what challenge you are facing. There is no\nneed for completely different strategies for each habit.\nWhenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:\n1. \nHow can I make it obvious?\n2. \nHow can I make it attractive?\n3. \nHow can I make it easy?\n4. \nHow can I make it satisfying?\nIf you have ever wondered, “Why don’t I do what I say I’m going to do? Why\ndon’t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start that side\nbusiness? Why do I say something is important but never seem to make time for\nit?” The answers to those questions can be found somewhere in these four laws.\n\n\nThe key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these\nfundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications. Every goal is\ndoomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters that follow,\nwe will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can use them to create\na system in which good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither away.",

They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it\nattractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\n\n\nTHE 1ST LAW\nMake It Obvious\n\n\n4\nThe Man Who Didn’t Look Right\nTHE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a\nfamily gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving\nat the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got very concerned.\n“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.\nHer father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied, “Well, I\ndon’t like your looks, either.”\n“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”\nA few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an\nexamination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was at\nimmediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law’s intuition, he\ncould have died.\nWhat did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart attack?\nWhen major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood to\ncritical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the skin.\nThe result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face. After\nmany years of working with people with heart failure, the woman had\nunknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She\ncouldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she\nknew something was wrong.\nSimilar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts can identify\nwhich blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and which one is a plane from\ntheir own fleet even though they are traveling at the same speed, flying at the\nsame altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the\nGulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship\nwhen he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly like\nthe battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but even his\nsuperior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.\n\nMuseum curators have been known to discern the difference between an\nauthentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they\ncan’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off. Experienced radiologists\ncan look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will develop before\nany obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye. I’ve even heard of\nhairdressers noticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel of her\nhair.\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your\nsurroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you\nexperience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart\nattack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain\nbegins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting\nthe relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain\noutcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain\nencodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it\nis we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability\nto notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit\nyou have.\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking.\nYou do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or\nyour stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on\nautopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.\nConsider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t\nnecessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to eat.\nAppetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body has a variety of\nfeedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to eat again and that track\nwhat is going on around you and within you. Cravings can arise thanks to\nhormones and chemicals circulating through your body. Suddenly, you’re\nhungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you off.\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to\nbe aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take\naction without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits\nuseful.\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come\nunder the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old\npatterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out, you\nmay not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand whenever you laugh,",

And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely\nyou become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift cards\nafter customers had used up the balance on the card. One day, the clerk cashed\nout a few customers in a row who purchased with gift cards. When the next\nperson walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s actual credit card, picked up\nthe scissors, and then cut it in half—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at\nthe stunned customer and realizing what had just happened.\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a former preschool teacher\nwho had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now working with\nadults, her old habits would kick in and she kept asking coworkers if they had\nwashed their hands after going to the bathroom. I also found the story of a man\nwho had spent years working as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell “Walk!”\nwhenever he saw a child running.\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are\nessentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to\nthe couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply\nencoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this\nreason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.\nBefore we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our\ncurrent ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is\nfirmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit\nremains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung\nsaid, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you\nwill call it fate.”\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you\never find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have\na peculiar habit.\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at\ndifferent objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal,\nthe operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and\nout of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the\nexact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and\nstate the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar\nactions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the\n\nplatform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and\nnamed aloud.*\nThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to\nreduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-\nCalling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The\nMTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is\n“point-only,” and “within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly\nberthed subways fell 57 percent.”\nPointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness\nfrom a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators\nmust use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice\nproblems before something goes wrong.\nMy wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the\ndoor for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list.\n“I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my\nhusband.”\nThe more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously\nthink about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we\nbegin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last.\nWe’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question\nwhether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are\nlargely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of\nwhat we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad\nhabits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal\nlives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you\ncan use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list\nof your daily habits.\nHere’s a sample of where your list might start:\nWake up\nTurn off alarm\nCheck my phone\nGo to the bathroom\nWeigh myself\nTake a shower\nBrush my teeth\nFloss my teeth",

If you waste time online, notice that you are spending your life in a way\nthat you do not want to.\nThe first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you\nfeel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own\nlife. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome\nwill be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself\ngrabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t\nneed it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”\nHearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more\nreal. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into\nan old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember\na task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the\npost office after lunch,” increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re\ngetting yourself to acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the\ndifference.\nThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies like\nPointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to\nrecognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes\nit possible to respond in a way that benefits you.\n\nChapter Summary\nWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict\ncertain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.\nOnce our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what\nwe are doing.\nThe process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You\nneed to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\nPointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a\nnonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your\nactions.\nThe Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more\naware of your behavior.\n\n\n5\nThe Best Way to Start a New Habit\nIN 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better\nexercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into\nthree groups.\nThe first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how\noften they exercised.\nThe second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to\ntrack their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise.\nThe researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk\nof coronary heart disease and improve heart health.\nFinally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same\npresentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of\nmotivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and\nwhere they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member\nof the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I\nwill partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in\n[PLACE].”\nIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least\nonce per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second\ngroup seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the\nthird group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.\nThe sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation\nintention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.\nThat is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.\nThe cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of\nyour phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the\nsound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and\nlocation. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.",

      "content": "Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:\n“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”\nHundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective\nfor sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of\nwhen you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy\nappointment. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like\nrecycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking.\nResearchers have even found that voter turnout increases when people are\nforced to create implementation intentions by answering questions like: “What\nroute are you taking to the polling station? At what time are you planning to go?\nWhat bus will get you there?” Other successful government programs have\nprompted citizens to make a clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided\ndirections on when and where to pay late traffic bills.\nThe punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where\nthey will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too many\npeople try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell\nourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we\nnever say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to\nchance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the\nright time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want\nto work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote” and\ntransforms them into a concrete plan of action.\nMany people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.\nIt is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their\nentire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.\nOnce an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for\ninspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this\nmorning or at lunch? When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to\nmake a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\nThe simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this\nsentence:\nI will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].\nMeditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.\n\nStudying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my\nbedroom.\nExercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.\nMarriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.\nIf you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week,\nmonth, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope\nis usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start\nfeels motivating.\nThere is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about\nwhat you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail\nprogress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. We often say yes to\nlittle requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing\ninstead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all\nday long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.\nGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make\nthe time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to\ndo the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As the writer\nJason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without\nconscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get\nantsy around the time of day you normally work out.”\nThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life and work.\nMy favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ Fogg and it is\na strategy I refer to as habit stacking.\nHABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS\nThe French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty, but\nthat all changed one day in 1765.\nDiderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford to pay for\nthe wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known for his role as\nthe co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most comprehensive\nencyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia,\nheard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a book\nlover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s\npersonal library for £1,000—more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had\nmoney to spare. With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also",

      "content": "acquired a scarlet robe for himself.\nDiderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately\nnoticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common\npossessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no\nmore beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff.\nDiderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with\none from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He\nbought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed\naside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase\nled to the next.\nDiderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to\nlead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that\nobtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to\nadditional purchases.\nYou can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get new\nshoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly question the layout\nof your entire living room. You buy a toy for your child and soon find yourself\npurchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It’s a chain reaction of\npurchases.\nMany human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next\nbased on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to\nwashing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the\ndirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the shopping list, and\nso on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers\nthe next behavior.\nWhy is this important?\nWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of\nbehavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to\nidentify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new\nbehavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\nHabit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than\npairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a\ncurrent habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny\nHabits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.*\nThe habit stacking formula is:\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n\nFIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits\ntogether, each one acting as the cue for the next.\nYour morning routine habit stack might look like this:\n1. \nAfter I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty\nseconds.\n2. \nAfter I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the\nday.\n3. \nAfter I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my\nfirst task.\nOr, consider this habit stack in the evening:\n\n\n1. \nAfter I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the\ndishwasher.\n2. \nAfter I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the counter.\n3. \nAfter I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for\ntomorrow morning.\nYou can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines.\nFor example, you may already have a morning routine that looks like this: Wake\nup > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you want to develop the habit of\nreading more each night. You can expand your habit stack and try something\nlike: Wake up > Make my bed > Place a book on my pillow > Take a shower.\nNow, when you climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting\nfor you to enjoy.\nOverall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide\nyour future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action\nshould come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can\ndevelop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:\nExercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using\nthe elevator.\nSocial skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to\nsomeone I don’t know yet.\nFinances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait\ntwenty-four hours before purchasing.\nHealthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies\non my plate first.\nMinimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.\n(“One in, one out.”)\nMood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile\nbefore answering.\nForgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and\nchairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.\nNo matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit\nstack is selecting the right cue to kick things off. Unlike an implementation\nintention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior,",

Many people select cues that are too vague. I made this mistake\nmyself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take\na break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded\nreasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups\nbefore I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few\ninconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for\nlunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.\nHabits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do\nnot provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I\nclose the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The\nspecificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific\ncue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.

The shaded boxes indicate areas where bottled\nwater was available in each instance. Because the amount of water in the environment was increased, behavior shifted naturally and without additional motivation.\nPeople often choose products not because of what they are, but because of\nwhere they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the\ncounter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking\nabout them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table\nat the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not\nto grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you\nare in and the cues in front of you.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our\nunique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under\ncertain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On\na dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form\nof change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us.\nEvery habit is context dependent.\nIn 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a\npowerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment,\nor B = f (P,E).\nIt didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the\neconomist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse\nBuying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and\nvisualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will occasionally buy\nproducts not because they want them but because of how they are presented to",

For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand names featured in\neasy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the most profit, while\ncheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for\nend caps, which are the units at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking\nmachines for retailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of\nfoot traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from\nend-of-the-aisle racks.\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are\nto try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks\nbecause it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in control. If we\nchoose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth,\nhowever, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by\npurposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and understanding the\nworld. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision. Snakes can smell by\n“tasting the air” with their highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small\namounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by nearby fish. Even\nbacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic\nchemicals in their environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We perceive\nthe world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also have other\nways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious. For\ninstance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops before a storm, or when\nthe pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance\nwhile walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range\nof internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink\nwhen thirsty.\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The\nhuman body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten\nmillion of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the\nbrain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision\nthan on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the\ngreatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see\ncan lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how\nimportant it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive\ncues and devoid of unproductive ones.\n\nof your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\nHOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS\nDuring the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch researchers began\nto pay close attention to the country’s energy usage. In one suburb near\nAmsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less energy than\ntheir neighbors—despite the homes being of similar size and getting electricity\nfor the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical except for\none feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had one in the basement.\nOthers had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway. As you may guess,\nthe homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity.\nWhen their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their\nbehavior.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that\nstand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make\nit easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the\nbehavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet.\nIt’s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest\nroom. It’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry.\nWhen the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a\ndesired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in\nAmsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each\nurinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they\nthought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced\n“spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut\nbathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to buy\napples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the refrigerator,\nand forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the apples would have\ngone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I bought a\nlarge display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen counter. The next\ntime I bought apples, that was where they went—out in the open where I could\nsee them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few apples each day simply\nbecause they were obvious rather than out of sight.",

      "content": "Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues\nfor your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your\npill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand\nin the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of\nstationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each\nmorning and place them in common locations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of\nyour environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.\nConsider how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a\ncigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at work, and\nso on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers\nthroughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your\nhabit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one.\nMaking a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are\nright in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage\nwith the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world\nothers have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and\nwork to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to\nnegative ones. Environment design allows you to take back control and become\nthe architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the\nconsumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits\nbecome associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context\nsurrounding the behavior.\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations than they would\never drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation:\n\nwatching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers\non tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home,\nthe office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and\nroutines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk,\nthe items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.\nOur behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our\nrelationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of\nthe environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as\nfilled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in\nterms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch\nis the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch\nis where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different\npeople can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with\nthe same place.\nThe good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a\nparticular context.\nIn one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they\nwere tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a different room\nuntil they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of\ntheir bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep\nwhen they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on\ntheir phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only\naction that happened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier\nto change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues\nthat nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee\nshop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a\nnew routine there.\nIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new\nhabit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you\nwatch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living\nroom without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games.\nBut when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral\nbiases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new\nhabits to form without interruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a\nbuilding with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do",

You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy\nfood when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or\nrearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise,\nentertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from my\ncouch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very difficult to stop\nworking. There was no clear division between the end of work time and the\nbeginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my office or the space where I\nate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything\nhappened in the same place.\nA few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate\nroom for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and\npersonal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for me to\nturn off the professional side of my brain when there was a clear dividing line\nbetween work life and home life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen\nwas for cooking. The office was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When\nyou start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will\nusually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is\nboth a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks,\nwhich makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do\nnearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be\nproductive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and\nplay video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York City. My\napartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple roles.”\nFair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a\nchair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with\nyour digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his\ntablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every\nhabit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become\nassociated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under\npredictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are\n\nenvironment that is stable and predictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an\nenvironment where habits can easily form.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over\ntime.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that\nstand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.\nGradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but\nwith the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes\nthe cue.\nIt is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are\nnot fighting against old cues.\n\n\n7\nThe Secret to Self-Control\nIN 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen\nRobert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a\ndiscovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had\nlearned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts.\nFollow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had\ntried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was even\nworse than they had initially thought.\nThe discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the creation\nof the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under President Nixon to\npromote prevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service members\nwhen they returned home.\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely\nupended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers\nwho had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became\nreaddicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other\nwords, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam\neliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\nThis finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered\nheroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins\nrevealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical\nchange in the environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by\ncues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the\nconstant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also\nheroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier\nreturned to the United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid\nof those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes",

It’s no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact\nopposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users\nbecome readdicted once they return home from rehab.\nThe Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad\nhabits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior\nas a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been\ntold your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that\nyou’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our\nproblems is deeply embedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however, shows something different. When scientists\nanalyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those\nindividuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead,\n“disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not\nrequire heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in\ntempting situations.\nThe people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it\nthe least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very\noften. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the\nway to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined\nperson, but by creating a more disciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what\nhappens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in\nthe mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises. When Patty\nOlwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking, she would often light up\nwhile riding horses with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it\nfor years. She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse\nagain and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever. The cues\nwere still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the\nenvironmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change techniques can\nbackfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them\nfeel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy:\n\nthey try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food,\nyou feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more\ntelevision because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying\nabout your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease\nyour anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more\nanxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external\ntrigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice\nsomething, you begin to want it. This process is happening all the time—often\nwithout us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing addicts a picture of\ncocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the\nbrain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously\nregister—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved\nthe drug all the same.\nHere’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.\nOnce the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are\nnearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.\nAnd that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is\nhard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too\nmuch energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the\nlong-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it\nbluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a\nnegative environment.\nA more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the\nmost practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that\ncauses it.\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another\nroom for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following\nsocial media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out\nof the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading\nreviews of the latest tech gear.\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it\nin a closet after each use.",

Tinbergen\n—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was investigating herring\ngulls, the gray and white birds often seen flying along the seashores of North\nAmerica.\nAdult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen noticed\nthat newly hatched chicks would peck this spot whenever they wanted food. To\nbegin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a\nhead without a body. When the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest\nand offered these dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes,\nand he assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether.\nHowever, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they\npecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They had a clear\npreference for those red spots—as if they had been genetically programmed at\nbirth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the bigger the red spot, the faster the\nchicks pecked. Eventually, he created a beak with three large red dots on it.\nWhen he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went crazy with delight. They\npecked at the little red patches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other animals.\nFor example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird. Occasionally, as the\nmother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle on the\ngrass nearby. Whenever this happens, the goose will waddle over to the egg and\nuse its beak and neck to pull it back into the nest.\nTinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as\na billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater\ntheir response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball\nback and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the",

      "content": "greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object\nnearby, I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I\nshould try to get it.\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior,\nand when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a\nChristmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli.\nA supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with\nthree red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger\nresponse than usual.\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food,\nfor example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds\nof thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain\nhas evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often\ncalorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming\nthe savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from,\neating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.\nToday, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but\nyour brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt,\nsugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists\nbecause the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty\nthousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic\ninstincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that are more attractive to\nconsumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some\nway, if only with additional flavoring. Companies spend millions of dollars to\ndiscover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect\namount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a\nproduct feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for\nexample, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the outside,\nlight and smooth on the inside.\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a\ncombination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy. Imagine the gooeyness of\nmelted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an Oreo cookie\ncombined with its smooth center. With natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to\nexperience the same sensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of\nkale taste? After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel\nfull. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and\n\neach product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your\nbrain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is that you\novereat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human brain. As\nStephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and\nobesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”\nThe modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just\none example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more\nattractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\nLook around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that\nare more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature\nmannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media\ndelivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the\noffice or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that\nwould be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a\ncombination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—\neven the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the\nsupernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are\nnaturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into\nexcessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and\nmany others.\nIf history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more\nattractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become more\nconcentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more\nconcentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more concentrated\nform of play than board games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed\nexperiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but\ntemptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to\nmake it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn\nhow to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every\nhabit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do\nthis, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the\ndopamine spike.\nTHE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP",

      "content": "Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a\nneurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine became\napparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an\nexperiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire.\nBy implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release\nof dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They\nwouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few\ndays, the animals died of thirst.\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing\nparts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the\nmouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with\npleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked,\nthey liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The\nability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And\nwithout desire, action stopped.\nWhen other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system\nof the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one\nstudy, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose\nin a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so strong they began\npoking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so\ndifferent: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times\nper hour.)\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly\nhabit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing\nsocial media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be\nsaid for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water,\nhaving sex, and interacting socially.\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we\nknow it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including\nmotivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary\nmovement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not\nonly when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling\naddicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win.\nCocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after\nthey take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your\nlevels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does\nyour motivation to act.\n\naction.\nInterestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive\na reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This\nis one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the\nattainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than\nopening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be\nmore enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the\ndifference between “wanting” and “liking.”\nTHE DOPAMINE SPIKE\n\n\nFIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine rises before taking action, immediately\nafter a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is\nexperienced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the\ndopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and dopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward does not\ncome as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally, when the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikes again. It is as if the brain is saying, “See! I\nknew I was right. Don’t forget to repeat this action next time.”\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than\nfor liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the\nnucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the",

They are often referred to as “hedonic hot\nspots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,\nresearchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated\nduring wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during\nliking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions\nresponsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role\nthese processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is\ntaken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to\nthe response.\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We\nneed to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding\nexperience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy\nknown as temptation bundling comes into play.\nHOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS\nMORE ATTRACTIVE\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed\nwatching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more often than he\ndid. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike and\nconnected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a computer program that\nwould allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed\ndown for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started\npedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating obesity one Netflix\nbinge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit more\nattractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with\nan action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the\nthing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the\nAmerican Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC, launched its\nThursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted\ntemptation bundling on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday, the company would air three shows created by screenwriter\nShonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away with Murder.\nThey branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s Thursday).\n\nIn addition to promoting the shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn,\ndrink red wine, and enjoy the evening.\nAndrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind the\ncampaign: “We see Thursday night as a viewership opportunity, with either\ncouples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun\nand drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy\nis that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their\nshows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and\neat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed and\nentertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday,\nthen eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means relaxation and entertainment. The\nreward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of turning on the television\nbecomes more attractive.\nYou’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your\nfavorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest\ncelebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you\ncould only read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym. Maybe you\nwant to get a pedicure, but you need to clean out your email inbox. Solution:\nonly get a pedicure while processing overdue work emails.\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as\nPremack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the\nprinciple states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\nbehaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue\nwork emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do\nsomething you really want to do along the way.\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy\nwe discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior.\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:\n1. \nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\n2. \nAfter [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\nIf you want to read the news, but you need to express more gratitude:",

In fact, it was all he believed in: he\ncompletely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with deliberate\npractice and the development of good habits, a child could become a genius in\nany field. His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his own\nchildren—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a wife willing to\njump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she may not have been as\nadamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper instruction, anyone could\nadvance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid\nout a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be\nhome-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with\nchess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play\nagainst each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could\nfind. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history\nof every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.\nLaszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars were\nparents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old. Within\nsix months, she was defeating adults.\nSofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world\nchampion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her father.\nAt twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one hundred",

For twenty-seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female\nchess player in the world.\nThe childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least. And yet, if\nyou ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In\ninterviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather than\ngrueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo\nreportedly found Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.\nEncouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces alone!” To\nwhich she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”\nThe Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else—\npraised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess\nwas normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your\nculture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\nHumans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the\nrespect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival.\nFor most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming\nseparated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence. “The\nlone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”*\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased\nsafety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted,\n“In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and\nimprovise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest\nhuman desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful\ninfluence on our modern behavior.\nWe don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script\nhanded down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local\ncommunity and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes with\nits own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to get married,\nhow many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much money to\nspend on your child’s birthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the\ninvisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them\nin mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the habits\nof your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without\n\nremembering. As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The\ncustoms and practices of life in society sweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden.\nEveryone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that rewards you for your\nchess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do. If you\nwork in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to\nsplurge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a\nnew phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors\nare attractive when they help us fit in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. \nThe close.\n2. \nThe many.\n3. \nThe powerful.\nEach group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change\nand make our habits more attractive.\n1. Imitating the Close\nProximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the physical\nenvironment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the social\nenvironment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents\nhandle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our\ncoworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When\nyour wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to\nbed, you pick it up as well.\nI find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without realizing it.\nIn conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of the other person.\nIn college, I began to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other countries,\nI unconsciously imitate the local accent despite reminding myself to stop.\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to\nimitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand\npeople for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s chances of becoming\nobese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.” It\nworks the other way, too. Another study found that if one person in a",

Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that\npulls us in their direction.\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad influences.\nWhen astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT, he took a small\nrobotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your\ngoal was to make it into space, then that room was about the best culture you\ncould ask for. Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at\nage eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after\ncontrolling for natural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities and\npractices of those around us.\nOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a\nculture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem\nachievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by\nfit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If\nyou’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to\nplay jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.”\nSurround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.\nYou’ll rise together.\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step\nfurther.\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2)\nyou already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an\nentrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which\n“helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight, get strong, and get healthy.” His\nclients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to\nget in shape. Many people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym or\ntry to change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other members of the\ngroup in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change becomes\nmore appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.\nNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a\npersonal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your\nidentity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete.\nWhen you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes\nlinked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual\npursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity\nbegins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group\n\nwhere everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the participants\nwere shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones, except the actors\nin the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they\nwould respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would\nagree that the lines were the same even though they were clearly different.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become\nbewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh nervously to\nthemselves. They would double-check the reactions of other participants. Their\nagitation would grow as one person after another delivered the same incorrect\nresponse. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they\ndelivered the answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What he\ndiscovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the conformity of\nthe subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there was no effect on\nthe person’s choice. They just assumed they were in the room with a dummy.\nWhen two actors were in the room with the subject, there was still little impact.\nBut as the number of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to\neight, the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of\nthe experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the group\nanswer even though it was obviously incorrect.\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our\nbehavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is\neveryone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor\nbecause we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s\nusually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the\nindividual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an\neffective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to\na new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior\nnut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.\nHumans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the\nnorms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the\nreward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d\nrather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.\nThe human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along",

Imitating the Powerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins and\nmedallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our titles. We want to\nbe acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can seem vain, but\noverall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a person with greater power and status\nhas access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a\nmore attractive mate.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and\nstatus. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician\nwho can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most\naccomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once\nwe fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective\npeople. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire\nsuccess ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.\nYou replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful firms in your\nindustry. You make a recipe from your favorite baker. You borrow the\nstorytelling strategies of your favorite writer. You mimic the communication\nstyle of your boss. We imitate people we envy.\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that\nmeans if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We\ntrim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the\nneighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because\nwe don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others\nthink of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.\nThe Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of this\nchapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social influences can\nhave on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for many hours each day and\ncontinued this remarkable effort for decades. But these habits and behaviors\nmaintained their attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their\nculture. From the praise of their parents to the achievement of different status\nmarkers like becoming a grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their\n\n\neffort.\n\neffort.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture\nbecause we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family\nand friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status\nand prestige).\nOne of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to\njoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior\nand (2) you already have something in common with the group.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired\nbehavior of the individual.

I was in the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey\nand my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a few feet away.\nMike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had been\nliving in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me around while I was\nvisiting the country and I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had been\ninvited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish friends.\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some point,\nsmoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of the Turks how he\ngot started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your friends. One friend\nsmokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room had\nmanaged to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few years at that\npoint, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit because of a book\ncalled Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells you: ‘Stop\nlying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to smoke. You know you\ndon’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim anymore. You\nstart to realize that you don’t need to smoke.”\nI had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book afterward out of\ncuriosity. The author employs an interesting strategy to help smokers eliminate\ntheir cravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated with smoking and\ngives it a new meaning.\nHe says things like:",

You can be social without smoking at all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does\nnot relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\nOver and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly\ninto your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making\nmarvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in\nconfidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and\nquality of your future life.”\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the most\nridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect smoking to bring\nyou any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the 2nd Law\nof Behavior Change: make it unattractive.\nNow, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your mind and\nyou can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.\nWHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. I\noften have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you\nwere to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say, “Because I need food to\nsurvive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to eat tacos\nbecause I have to eat to survive. The underlying motive is to obtain food and\nwater even if my specific craving is for a taco.\nSome of our underlying motives include:*\nConserve energy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\n\nA craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your\nbrain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to\nplay video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and\nrelieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not\ncreate a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of\nhuman nature.\nFind love and reproduce = using Tinder\nConnect and bond with others = browsing Facebook\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old\nvices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The\nspecific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.\nHere’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same\nunderlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a\ncigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your\ncurrent habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face;\nthey are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with\nthe problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.\nHabits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we\npredict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of\nthe 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in\nthe environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation\nand makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.\nCue: You notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.\nCue: You see that the traffic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection and\nget closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the\nappropriate response.",

      "content": "This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits because\nevery action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually\npredictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given\nwhat you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are\nendlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way, our\nbehavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us,\nnot necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves. Two people can\nlook at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is\nrepulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit\ndepending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction\nthat precedes them.\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a\ncraving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues\nwe perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They\nhelp explain what we are currently sensing. For instance, whether or not you\nrealize it, you are noticing how warm or cold you feel right now. If the\ntemperature drops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the\ntemperature drops ten degrees, however, you’ll feel cold and put on another\nlayer of clothing. Feeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have\nbeen sensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that you\nwould be better off in a different state that you take action.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change\nyour internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your\nbody is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your\ncurrent state and your desired state provides a reason to act.\nDesire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be\nin the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel\ndifferently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse\nsocial media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch\nof likes. What you really want is to feel different.\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or\nto make a change. They help us decide the best course of action. Neurologists\nhave discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose\nthe ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to\navoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that\n\nhabit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In\ntime, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or\nthat watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive\nwhen we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our\nadvantage rather than to our detriment.\nHOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with\na positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For\ninstance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have\nto wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your\nbusiness. You have to cook dinner for your family.\nNow, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.\nYou get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for\nyour business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one\nword, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these\nbehaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those\nthings, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set\nwe choose.\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was\ndifficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I\nam liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and\nnever able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed\nhow he lived each day.\nReframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is\na fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more\nattractive.\nExercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that\ndrains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to\ndevelop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in\nthe morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”\nFinance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can\nassociate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth:\nliving below your current means increases your future means. The money you\nsave this month increases your purchasing power next month.\nMeditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds",

You can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each\ninterruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath. Distraction\nis a good thing because you need distractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big\npresentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker\nbreathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings\nnegatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings\npositively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am\nnervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me\nconcentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change the feelings\nyou associate with a particular habit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You\nsimply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can\nuse that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if you always\nplay the same song before having sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with\nthe act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press play.\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar\nstrategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and\nconcentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t\neven have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself.\nIn the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and\ndid focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones\non became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The\ncraving followed naturally.\nAthletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to perform.\nDuring my baseball career, I developed a specific ritual of stretching and\nthrowing before each game. The whole sequence took about ten minutes, and I\ndid it the same way every single time. While it physically warmed me up to play,\nmore importantly, it put me in the right mental state. I began to associate my\npregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated\nbeforehand, by the time I was done with my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel\nhappier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting\nyour dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you\n\nEventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being\nin a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established,\nyou can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed\nat work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths\nand smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it\nhas little to do with the original situation.\nThe key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the\nassociations you have about them.

They would be graded solely on the amount of work they\nproduced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos\nsubmitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a\nB, eighty photos a C, and so on.\nMeanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality”\ngroup. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would\nonly need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be\na nearly perfect image.\nAt the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were\nproduced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy\ntaking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various\nmethods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of\ncreating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality\ngroup sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show\nfor their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.*\nIt is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the\nfastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for\na side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never\nget around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of\nthe good.”\nI refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The\ntwo ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion,\nyou’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but\nthey don’t produce a result.\n\nAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.\nIf I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit\ndown and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read\na few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s\naction.\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It\ndoesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion\nwill never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result\nyou’re looking to achieve.\nIf motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it\nbecause we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do\nit because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running\nthe risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel\ngood to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that\nmight happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than\ntaking action: you want to delay failure.\nIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making\nprogress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients\nright now. This is good. We’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I\nbrainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This is coming together.”\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just\npreparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of\nprocrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be\nplanning. You want to be practicing.\nIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.\nYou don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to\npractice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your\nreps in.\nHOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more\nautomatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the\nstructure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.\nNeuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening\nof connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.\nWith each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections\ntighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this",

      "content": "phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together\nwire together.”\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In musicians,\nthe cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking a guitar string or\npulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians. Mathematicians,\nmeanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior parietal lobule, which\nplays a key role in computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated\nwith the amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the\nmathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.\nWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that\nthe hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—was\nsignificantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more\nfascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired. Like the\nmuscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of\nthe brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.\nOf course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was recognized\nlong before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the English\nphilosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to\nplay on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great\ndifficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass\nhave not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a\npathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they\ncan be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” Both common sense\nand scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.\nEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit\nassociated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of\nthe most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It is why the\nstudents who took tons of photos improved their skills while those who merely\ntheorized about perfect photos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the\nother in passive learning. One in action, the other in motion.\nAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic\nbehavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform\na behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the\nnonconscious mind takes over.\nIt looks something like this:\nTHE HABIT LINE\n\nFIGURE 11: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious\nattention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking.\nA new habit has been formed.\nOn the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers track the\nlevel of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten minutes each day.\nThe shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an\nimportant truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not\ntime.\nWALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY\n\n\nFIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking for ten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as the repetitions increase, so does automaticity, until the\nbehavior is as easy and automatic as it can be.\nOne of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a\nnew habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take\nto form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit\nautomatic?\nThere is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It\ndoesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days.\nWhat matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do\nsomething twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s the frequency that\nmakes the difference. Your current habits have been internalized over the course\nof hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level\nof frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the\nbehavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.\nIn practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to become\nautomatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to take to make\nprogress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance.\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make\npractice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy.\nThe chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly that.",

      "content": "FIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the\nAmericas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere. The behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or\nthousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction in the environment.\nBy comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to south.\nJust imagine how different the weather is in Florida compared to Canada. You\ncan be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’t help you grow Florida\noranges in the Canadian winter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order to\nspread crops along north-south routes, farmers would need to find and\ndomesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.\nAs a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and\nEurope than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries, this\nsmall difference had a very big impact. Increased food production allowed for\nmore rapid population growth. With more people, these cultures were able to\nbuild stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new technologies.\nThe changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population\nthat grew slightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.\nThe spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of Behavior\nChange on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key\nto habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth\nis, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite\nwhat the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a\n\ndumb one.\nEnergy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It\nis human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when\ndeciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the\noption that requires the least amount of work.* For example, expanding your\nfarm to the east where you can grow the same crops rather than heading north\nwhere the climate is different. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the\none that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We\nare motivated to do what is easy.\nEvery action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required,\nthe less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred push-ups per day,\nthat’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and excited, you\ncan muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort\nfeels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day\nrequires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the\nmore likely it is to occur.\nLook at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see that it can\nbe performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on our\nphones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our time\nbecause they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably\nconvenient.\nIn a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.\nDieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm.\nJournaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit\nitself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the\nobstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between\nyou and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so\neasy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your\ngood habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.\nBut what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If we’re all\nso lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard things like raising a\nchild or starting a business or climbing Mount Everest?\nCertainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is that\nsome days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like giving\nin. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor\nas possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your\nway. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge.",

      "content": "HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT\nImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water\ncan flow through, but not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which\nwater passes through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank\nup the valve and force more water out. The second option is to simply remove\nthe bend in the hose and let water flow through naturally.\nTrying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to\nforce water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and\nincreases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and\neasy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the\nfriction in your life, you reduce it.\nOne of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your\nhabits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment\ndesign as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize\nyour environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to\npractice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of\nyour daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your\nlife. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because\nstopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym\nis off the path of your normal commute—even by just a few blocks—now you’re\ngoing “out of your way” to get there.\nPerhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or\noffice. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try to\nfollow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. We try to write a\nbook in a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a smartphone\nfilled with distractions. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can remove the points\nof friction that hold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in\nJapan began to do in the 1970s.\nIn an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the Time,” James\nSuroweicki writes:\n“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’\nrelentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process,\ndown to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting\nand turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more\nefficient and Japanese products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974,\nservice calls for American-made color televisions were five times as common as\nfor Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long\n\nI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The Japanese\ncompanies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and\neliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and\nrevenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and\nenergy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can\nfeel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the\ncognitive load our environment places on us.)\nIf you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the\nthings these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your\nlife. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating\napps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services\nreduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of\nsending a letter in the mail.\nLike a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to\nreduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate,\neliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of\nfields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an\naccount. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask\ntheir customers to make fewer choices.\nWhen the first voice-activated speakers were released—products like Google\nHome, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what he liked\nabout the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to say “Play some\ncountry music” than to pull out his phone, open the music app, and pick a\nplaylist. Of course, just a few years earlier, having unlimited access to music in\nyour pocket was a remarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving to the\nstore and buying a CD. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same\nresult in an easier fashion.\nSimilar strategies have been used effectively by governments. When the\nBritish government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they switched from\nsending citizens to a web page where the tax form could be downloaded to\nlinking directly to the form. Reducing that one step in the process increased the\nresponse rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. For a country like the United\nKingdom, those percentage points represent millions in tax revenue.\nThe central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as\neasy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to\nfinding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase\nthe friction associated with our bad ones.",

      "content": "PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is also\nsomeone who understands the power of priming his environment.\nNuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to as\n“resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes watching television, he\nplaces the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch, and\nfolds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever\nhe takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As\nhe notes, the “perfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in\nthe shower anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean\nup after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.\n“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote.\n“Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. . . .\nPeople think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It\ngives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to\nmake the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards\nthat are presorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding, graduation, and\nmore. Whenever necessary, she grabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is\nincredibly good at remembering to send cards because she has reduced the\nfriction of doing so. For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby\nand I would think, “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass and by the\ntime I remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The habit wasn’t\neasy.\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate\nuse. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the\ncooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils you’ll need the\nnight before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.\nWant to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing\ntools on top of your desk, within easy reach.\nWant to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and\nwater bottle ahead of time.\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on\nweekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to\nhealthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.\n\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance.\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad\nbehaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much television, for\nexample, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out\nloud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates just enough\nfriction to prevent mindless viewing.\nIf that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the television and\ntake the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra ten seconds\nto turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the television out of the\nliving room and into a closet after each use. You can be sure you’ll only take it\nout when you really want to watch something. The greater the friction, the less\nlikely the habit.\nWhenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch. When\nit’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at all. But when it is\nin another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high enough that I\nwon’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get three to four hours each\nmorning when I can work without interruption.\nIf sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell a friend\nor family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a coworker to keep it\nat their desk in the morning and give it back to you at lunch.\nIt is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behavior.\nWhen I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t see it, I drink less. When\nI delete social media apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I download\nthem again and log in. These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for\nmany of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a\ngood habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making\ndozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to make the good\nbehaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.\nWhether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a\ncoach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can we\ndesign a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so the\nactions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.",

In 1992, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, often\nreferred to as the Genius Grant, and she has spent the bulk of her career touring\nthe globe to perform her original works. She also credits much of her success to\nsimple daily habits.\n“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30\nA.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my hat. I\nwalk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to\nthe Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First Avenue, where I work out for two\nhours.\n“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through\neach morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver\nwhere to go I have completed the ritual.\n“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it—\nmakes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it\ndifferently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to\nthink about.”\nHailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid example\nof the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nResearchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are\ndone out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence\nof your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic\nchoices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be\ncompleted in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take\nfor minutes or hours afterward.\nHabits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path\n\nand, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to\nbe easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something\ndifferent. You sit through a bad movie for two hours. You keep snacking even\nwhen you’re already full. You check your phone for “just a second” and soon\nyou have spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you\nfollow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are\nthinking.\nEach evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that shapes\nthe rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and either we change\ninto our workout clothes and head to the gym or we crash onto the couch, order\nIndian food, and watch The Office.* Similar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the\nritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the\nworkout will happen. Everything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding\nwhich exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first\nstep.\nEvery day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I\nrefer to these little choices as decisive moments. The moment you decide\nbetween ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between\ndriving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting\nyour homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a fork\nin the road.\nDECISIVE MOMENTS\n\n\nFIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices\nstack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead to very different outcomes.\nDecisive moments set the options available to your future self. For instance,\nwalking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it determines what you’ll\nbe eating for lunch. Technically, you are in control of what you order, but in a\nlarger sense, you can only order an item if it is on the menu. If you walk into a\nsteakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your options are\nconstrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.\nWe are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the\ndecisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up of\nmany moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path\nyou take. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how\nyou spend the next chunk of time.",

      "content": "Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.\nTHE TWO-MINUTE RULE\nEven when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you\ndream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up\ntrying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this\ntendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new\nhabit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”\nYou’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute\nversion:\n“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”\n“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”\n“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\n“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”\n“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can\nmeditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And,\nas we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started\ndoing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should\nnot feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first\ntwo minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally\nleads you down a more productive path.\nYou can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired\noutcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.”\nFor instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking\nten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And\nputting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a\nmarathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how\nyou follow the Two-Minute Rule.\nVery easy\nEasy\nModerate\nHard\nVery hard\nPut on your running shoes\nWalk ten minutes\nWalk ten thousand steps\nRun a 5K\nRun a marathon\nWrite one sentence\nWrite one paragraph\nWrite one thousand words\nWrite a five-thousand-word article\nWrite a book\nOpen your notes\nStudy for ten minutes\nStudy for three hours\nGet straight A’s\nEarn a PhD\n\nPeople often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or\nmeditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one\nthing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must\nbe established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of\nshowing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of\ntrying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more\nconsistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.\nAs you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a\nritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make\nhabits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you\nritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip\ninto the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same\nwarm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak\nperformance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get\ninto the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit,\nyou make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. You may not be\nable to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless.\nMake it easy to start and the rest will follow.\nThe Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know that\nthe real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like you’re\ntrying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do one\npush-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a mental trick, why would you\nfall for it?\nIf the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then\nstop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Start meditating, but you\nmust stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you must stop after two minutes.\nIt’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit can only last one\nhundred and twenty seconds.\nOne of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In the\nbeginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed\nto stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for five\nminutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few weeks, he looked\naround and thought, “Well, I’m always coming here anyway. I might as well\nstart staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.\nJournaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from\ngetting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up",

Ernest Hemingway believed in similar\nadvice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are\ngoing good,” he said.\nStrategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity\nyou want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just\nfor two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not\nworried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person\nwho doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the\ntype of person you want to be.\nWe rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the\nend goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of guitar\npractice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never\npicking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\nAt some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each\nday, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit\nshaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by\nmastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then,\nadvance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first\ntwo minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level.\nEventually, you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while\nstill keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the\nbehavior.\nEXAMPLES OF HABIT SHAPING\nBecoming an Early Riser\nPhase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 2: Have all devices (TV, phone, etc.) turned off by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night (reading a book, talking with your partner).\nPhase 4: Lights off by 10 p.m. every night.\nPhase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day.\nBecoming Vegan\nPhase 1: Start eating vegetables at each meal.\nPhase 2: Stop eating animals with four legs (cow, pig, lamb, etc.).\nPhase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (chicken, turkey, etc.).\nPhase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (fish, clams, scallops, etc.).\nPhase 5: Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).\n\n14\nHow to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad\nHabits Impossible\nIN THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months\nearlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of\nwriting, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and\ndelaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline\nless than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of\nhis clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left\nwith nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go\noutdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter\nof 1830. The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on\nJanuary 14, 1831.*\nSometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about\nmaking bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change:\nmake it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on\nyour plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad\nhabits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device.\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your\nactions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good\nhabits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away\nso he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.*\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce\novereating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk size.\nYou can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online\npoker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of athletes who\nhave to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their wallets at home\nduring the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.",

At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts off the power to\nthe router. When the internet goes off, everyone knows it is time to go to bed.\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of\ngood intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking\nto cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box half of\nit to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told\nmyself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the\ngood habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape,\nschedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the\nbusiness you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a\nconsulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the\nmeeting, which requires effort and may cost money.\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the\nfuture by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even\nbetter. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nHOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT\nAGAIN\nJohn Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood\ndoing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After\nattending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small\nsupply store for coal miners.\nIt seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and\nenjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That\nwas when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.\nIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept\nin an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video\ncameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you\nwere willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to\nmanage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement\nfor a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. Designed by fellow\nDayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine\nautomatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction.\n\nPatterson bought two for fifty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months,\nPatterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the\nequivalent of more than $100,000 today.\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses. He\nbought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash Register\nCompany. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand\nemployees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful\nbusinesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the\nfriction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash\nregister was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically\nimpossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred\nbehavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again. These\nonetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value\nover time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver returns\nagain and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that\nlead to better long-term habits. The table on the following page shares some of\nthe most popular answers.\nI’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the onetime\nactions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to their habits—\nmost would find themselves living a better life a year from now. These onetime\nactions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.\nThey make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and\ngenerally live better.\nONETIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS\nNutrition\nBuy a water filter to clean your drinking water.\nUse smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.\nSleep\nBuy a good mattress.\nGet blackout curtains.\nRemove your television from your bedroom.\nProductivity\nUnsubscribe from emails.\nTurn off notifications and mute group chats.\nSet your phone to silent.\nUse email filters to clear up your inbox.",

Instead of pressing a button to advance to\nthe next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do\nis keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your\nsmallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have\nfood delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in\nthe vast expanse of social media. When the effort required to act on your desires\nbecomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse\narises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves\njumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but\nultimately more rewarding, work.\nI often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I\nfeel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write\noff these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can\naccumulate into a serious issue.

On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I\nhad the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday\nmorning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up\nwith a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the first week\nof locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it\nnearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day.

By 1998, over nine\nmillion people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a\ntransportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports in the\nregion. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the standard urban\namenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least\nlivable cities in the world.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements and slums.\nThese densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift houses cobbled\ntogether from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded materials. There\nwas no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean water supply. When\ndry, the streets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a\nmuddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and\nchildren played among the garbage.\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.\nContaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and\nabdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were malnourished.\nWith so many people crammed into such a small space, viruses and bacterial\ninfections spread rapidly. It was this public health crisis that had brought\nStephen Luby to Pakistan.\nLuby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation, the\nsimple habit of washing your hands could make a real difference in the health of\nthe residents. But they soon discovered that many people were already aware\nthat handwashing was important.\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their hands in\na haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands under the water\n\nquickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many would simply forget to wash\ntheir hands before preparing food. Everyone said handwashing was important,\nbut few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The\nproblem was consistency.\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to supply\nthe neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,\nusing Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The study\nparticipants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The soap foamed\neasily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.\nInstantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit\nadoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that\nprovides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory\nfeedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The marketing team at Procter & Gamble\ntalked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.”\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in\nthe neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48\npercent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\nThe long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of the\nhouseholds in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95 percent of\nhouseholds who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash their\nhands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when our study\nteam visited. . . . We had not given any soap to the intervention group for over\nfive years, but during the trial they had become so habituated to wash their\nhands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the\nfourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.\nThis is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing\nyour hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the\nbrain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain\nthat a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially\nthroughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it\nbecame a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland\nresins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry by adding",

Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”\nTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate\nreinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed,\nand Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world.\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success\nwhen they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their\nproducts. These flavors don’t improve the effectiveness of toothpaste. They\nsimply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing your\nteeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she\ndidn’t like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor,\nwhich proved to be more satisfying.\nConversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat\nit. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic\nrelative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this\negomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around.\nWithin a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so\nuninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What\nis rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in\nthe future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in\nthe past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.\nThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive,\nand make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.\nThe fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that\na behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.\nBut there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We\nare looking for immediate satisfaction.\nTHE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED\nREWARDS\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an elephant\nor a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an immediate impact.\nYou are always thinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to avoid a\npredator. You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You\nlive in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your\nactions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of the choices\n\nyou make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do a good job at work,\nyou’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today, perhaps you won’t\nbe overweight next year. If you save money now, maybe you’ll have enough for\nretirement decades from now. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return\nenvironment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the\nintended payoff.\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The\nearliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are\napproximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first humans to\nhave a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest\npart of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—\nwas roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are\nwalking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.\nIt is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has\nshifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.* Compared to the age of\nthe brain, modern society is brand-new. In the last one hundred years, we have\nseen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the\ninternet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in recent\nyears, but human nature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent their\ndays responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking shelter from\na storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. The distant\nfuture was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an\nimmediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to\nlong-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is,\nthe way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the\npresent more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward\nthat is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible\nin the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes\nproblems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer?\nWhy would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity?\nWhy would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually\ntransmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the\nanswers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the\nrewards are immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress",

      "content": "Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these\noutcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome\nusually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the\nreverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels\ngood. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly\nwhen he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence\nis favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the\nsweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”\nPut another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of\nyour bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on\ngood intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a\nlanguage—you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you\nenvision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking\nactions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves.\nHowever, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually\nwins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being\nfitter or wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be\nfull, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure\nyou get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns\nwith your long-term goals.*\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some behaviors\nand avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is\nimmediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.\nOur preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about\nsuccess: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing\nquick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed\ngratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less\ncompetition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is\nalways the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying\ngratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower\nlikelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve\nall seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching television and get\nyour homework done, you’ll generally learn more and get better grades. If you\n\nHere’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise\napproach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at\npeace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment.\nThankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to\nwork with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to\nadd a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run\nand a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\nHOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a\nsmall way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the\nwork was worth the effort.\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real\nworld, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you\nwith something. Early on, it’s all sacrifice. You’ve gone to the gym a few times,\nbut you’re not stronger or fitter or faster—at least, not in any noticeable sense.\nIt’s only months later, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some\ndefinition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own sake. In the beginning,\nyou need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential.\nThey keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate\nrewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital\nbecause we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of\nyour habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which\nrefers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a\nbehavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an\nimmediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your\nhabit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits\nof avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging\nto stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this month”\nbecause nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair\nof shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place.\nAll you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about\nthat.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance\nvisible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe",

Move $10 over. It’s like creating a loyalty program for\nyourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the\nleather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying\nto do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to stop\neating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled their savings\naccount “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they\ntransferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the money\ntoward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that\nreinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket\nis fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if\nyou’re trying to budget and save money. Instead, taking a bubble bath or going\non a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself with free time,\nwhich aligns with your ultimate goal of more freedom and financial\nindependence. Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice\ncream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a\nwash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a\nvote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with\nyour long-term vision of being a healthy person.\nEventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced\nstress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward.\nThe identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are\nand it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less\nyou need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit.\nIdentity sustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new identity to\nemerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term\nwhile you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\nIn summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of\nreinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing\nmint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate\npleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.\n\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\nsatisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed\nrewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded\nis repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.\nTo get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even\nif it’s in a small way.\nThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it\nattractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be\nperformed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it\nsatisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next\ntime.\n\n\n16\nHow to Stick with Good Habits Every Day\nIN 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker\nnamed Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in\nthe shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were\nbeing made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody\nexpected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily\nhabit.\nDyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with\n120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he\nwould make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from\nthe full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I\nwould start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone\nuntil I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.\nWithin eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm. By\nage twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000\ntoday. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company.\nI like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years,\nI’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman\nshifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her\nbook. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of\npush-ups.\nMaking progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips\nor hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result,\nthey reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any\nactivity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs,\nloyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page\nnumbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a\nhabit tracker.",

      "content": "HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most\nbasic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your\nroutine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each\nof those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your\nhabit streak.\nCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was\nBenjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small booklet\neverywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list\nincluded goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful”\nand “Avoid trifling conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open\nhis booklet and record his progress.\nJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing\njokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to\n“never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not\nfocused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is\nsimply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.\n“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales\ncalls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of\nworkouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of\ncreating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit\ntracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It\nsimultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.\nLet’s break down each one.\nBenefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit\ntracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your\ncalendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and\nsee your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people\nwho track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and\nlowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.\nOne study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a\ndaily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of\ntracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our\nown behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way\n\nto overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going\non each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and you immediately\nknow how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence\nis right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.\nBenefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\nThe most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we\nare moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In\nthis way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small\nwin feeds your desire.\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down,\nit’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking\nprovides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve\ncome. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get\nstarted because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak.\nBenefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.\nThis is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of\nreward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry\nin your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your\nresults grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book\nmanuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.\nHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the\nprocess rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re\njust trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t\nmiss workouts.\nIn summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act,\n(2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and\ndon’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another\nsuccessful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual\nproof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become,\nwhich is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*\nYou may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited so\nlong to talk about it?\nDespite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a simple reason:\nmany people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden",

      "content": "because it forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the\nhabit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle when you’re already\nstruggling to follow a diet. Writing down every sales call seems tedious when\nyou’ve got work to do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try\nharder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” People inevitably tell me things like, “I\nhave a decision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or, “I recorded my workouts\nfor a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I once made a food log to\ntrack my calories. I managed to do it for one meal and then gave up.\nTracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life.\nBut nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary.\nWhat can we do to make tracking easier?\nFirst, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll probably\nbe surprised by how much you’re already tracking without knowing it. Your\ncredit card statement tracks how often you go out to eat. Your Fitbit registers\nhow many steps you take and how long you sleep. Your calendar records how\nmany new places you travel to each year. Once you know where to get the data,\nadd a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more\npractical than tracking it every day.\nSecond, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is\nbetter to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.\nFinally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The\ncompletion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you\nto combine the habitstacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\nAfter I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip\nover.\nAfter I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout\njournal.\nAfter I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.\nThese tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you aren’t the type\nof person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think you’ll find a few weeks of\nmeasurements to be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve actually\n\nbeen spending your time.\nThat said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important than\nany single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits slide off\ntrack.\nHOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN\nNo matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will\ninterrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an\nemergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your\nfamily needs a little more of your time.\nWhenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never\nmiss twice.\nIf I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one\nworkout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat an\nentire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can\navoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one.\nThe first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated\nmistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a\nnew habit.\nThis is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have\na bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful\npeople fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the\nreclaiming of it is fast.\nI think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a\nhabit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall into an all-or-\nnothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is\nthinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.\nYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy)\ndays. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with\n$100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33\npercent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss\nis just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The\nfirst rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”\nThis is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish\ndays and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous\ngood days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up,\nanything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your",

It’s easy to train\nwhen you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—\neven if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not\nimprove your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.\nThe all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can derail\nyour habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are using a habit tracker\n—is measuring the wrong thing.\nKNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT\nSay you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is doing a\ngood job. One way to measure success is to track how many customers pay for a\nmeal each day. If more customers come in, the food must be good. If fewer\ncustomers come in, something must be wrong.\nHowever, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a limited picture\nof what’s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal doesn’t mean\nthey enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfied customers are unlikely to dine and dash.\nIn fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but\nyou’re making up for it with marketing or discounts or some other method.\nInstead, it may be more effective to track how many customers finish their meal\nor perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.\nThe dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by\nthe number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by\nquarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for\nquarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale,\nyou will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing\ncrash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win”\nwhatever game is being played.\nThis pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours\ninstead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten\nthousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests\ninstead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we\noptimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get\nthe wrong behavior.\nThis is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist\nCharles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it\n\nceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you\nand adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is\nsimply one piece of feedback in the overall system.\nIn our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue\nanything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the\nfactors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can\nmeasure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because\nyou can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.\nAll of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place. It can\nfeel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the measurement is\nnot the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to measure\nprogress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to something entirely\ndifferent.\nThis is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. The number\non the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number, your\nmotivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or you wake\nup earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid ways to track your\nimprovement. If you’re not feeling motivated by the number on the scale,\nperhaps it’s time to focus on a different measurement—one that gives you more\nsignals of progress.\nNo matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking offers a simple\nway to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement provides a little bit\nof evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a brief moment of\nimmediate pleasure for a job well done.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—\nlike marking an X on a calendar.\nHabit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your\nhabits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.\nDon’t break the chain.

But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear war\nescalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most interesting idea.\nAt the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could prevent\nnuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting president would\nhave access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would never\nactually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of miles away.\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear] code\nnumber in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of\na volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he\naccompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons,\nthe only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill\none human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens of millions\nmust die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an\ninnocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.\n“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God, that’s\nterrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He\nmight never push the button.’”\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have\ncovered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying. Fisher’s\nproposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is\nsatisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is\n\npainful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a\nfailure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more\ncostly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review\nforces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never\nreturning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong\nblood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When\nthe consequences are severe, people learn quickly.\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to\nprevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost\nto the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them\nhard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to\nincrease the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t\nbe a gap between the action and the consequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to\nchange. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee.\nStudents show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. We’ll jump\nthrough a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on punishment to\nchange behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative\nstrength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of\nprocrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of\nlaziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a\nrestaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only\nshifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence,\nthe more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The more global,\nintangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence\nindividual behavior.\nThankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any\nbad habit: create a habit contract.\nTHE HABIT CONTRACT\nThe first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At the\ntime, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a seat belt—\nbut that was all about to change.\nWithin five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today, wearing a",

      "content": "seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states. And it’s not just\nthe legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts has changed dramatically\nas well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans buckled up each time they got in\na car. In just over thirty years, there was a complete reversal in the habits of\nmillions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government can change our\nhabits by creating a social contract. As a society, we collectively agree to abide\nby certain rules and then enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of\nlegislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning smoking inside\nrestaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an example of a social contract shaping\nour habits. The group agrees to act in a certain way, and if you don’t follow\nalong, you’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a\nhabit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or\nwritten agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and\nthe punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then you find one or\ntwo people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract\nwith you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the first person\nI saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris\nrealized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract between\nhimself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The first version read, “Bryan’s #1\nobjective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating correctly again so he feels better, looks\nbetter, and is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal\noutcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.\nPhase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout\nprogram in Q3.\nFinally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to his goal.\nFor example, “Write down all food that he consumes each day and weigh\nhimself each day.”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do these two\nitems then the following consequence will be enforced: He will have to dress up\n\neach workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter. Dress up is\ndefined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey\n(his trainer) $200 to use as he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the\ncontract.\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and\nunnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that signing the\ncontract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I\nstart slacking almost immediately.”\nThree months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded his goals.\nThe consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein\ntargets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh himself, he had\nto give his wife $500 to use as she saw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to\nrun sprints, he had to dress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the\nrest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn team.\nThe strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as accountability\npartners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day,\nHarris lost the weight.*\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in\nthe moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.\nEven if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply having an\naccountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or\nsong every day. She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend, which helps\nthem both stay accountable. Knowing that someone is watching can be a\npowerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there\nis an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as\nuntrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your\npromises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in\nBoulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a\ntweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m\nlazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t\nmalfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb our\nhair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know these\nhabits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get good grades and\ngraduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates and our",

We\ncare deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others\nto have a lesser opinion of us.\nA habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It\nmakes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.\nKnowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful\nmotivator.\nHOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.\n1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”\n1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\n1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.\nThe 2nd Law:Make It Attractive\n2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\n2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.\n2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\nThe 3rd Law: Make It Easy\n3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.\n3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.\n3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.\n3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.\n3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.\nThe 4th Law: Make It Satisfying\n4.1: Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.\n4.2: Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.\n4.3: Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”\n4.4: Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.\nHOW TO BREAK A BAD HABIT\nInversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible\n\nADVANCED TACTICS\nHow to Go from Being Merely Good to Being\nTruly Great\n\n\n18\nThe Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter\nand When They Don’t)\nMANY PEOPLE ARE familiar with Michael Phelps, who is widely considered to be one of\nthe greatest athletes in history. Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only\nthan any swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any sport.\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic\nathlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two\nOlympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all\ntime. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and\n2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won\ngold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.\nThese two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters, one\ncompeted on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they differ\nsignificantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six\nfeet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference in height, the two men\nare identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the\nsame length inseam on their pants.\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a very\nlong torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs\nand a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance running.\nNow, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports. Given his\nremarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an Olympic-caliber\ndistance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At peak fitness, Phelps\nweighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El Guerrouj, who\ncompeted at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller runners are heavier runners, and\nevery extra pound is a curse when it comes to distance running. Against elite\ncompetition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history, but it’s",

      "content": "doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer. Since 1976, the\naverage height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is five\nfeet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in\nthe men’s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be\ntall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water.\nEl Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the pool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of\ncompetition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and\nbusiness. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when\nthey align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the\npool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the\nodds are in your favor.\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people\nare born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to discuss this fact. On\nthe surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s no fun to talk about things you\ncannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism makes it sound like\ncertain individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But\nthis is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily\nchanged, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable\ncircumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you\nwant to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very useful. If you want to\nperform a gymnastics routine, being seven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our\nenvironment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural\ntalents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine\nsuccess.\nThis is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as well.\nI’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so much when it\ncomes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence is highly\ndependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they\nare also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly great,\nselecting the right place to focus is crucial.\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of\nopportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they\ndon’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success\nare the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct\n\nThe obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my\nfavor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?” The\nfirst place we will look for an answer is by understanding your personality.\nHOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the\nsurface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything from\nthe number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry\nor divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There’s\na strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing\nauthority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive\nor reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during\nsensory experiences like attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral\ngeneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we\nhave stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we\nliterally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”\nBundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a\nparticular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is\nconsistent from situation to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of\npersonality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five\nspectrums of behavior.\n1. \nOpenness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to\ncautious and consistent on the other.\n2. \nConscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and\nspontaneous.\n3. \nExtroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you\nlikely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n4. \nAgreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and\ndetached.\n5. \nNeuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.\nAll five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for\ninstance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing\nward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers\ntracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward",

      "content": "the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away\nwere more likely to become introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. They\nalso tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an\nimportant role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act as a\nnatural antidepressant. You can easily imagine how someone with more\noxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing thank-you notes or\norganizing social events.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all\npeople possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be\nanxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for\nnoticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues\nin their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nOur habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt\nthat our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences\nmake certain behaviors easier for some people than for others. You don’t have to\napologize for these differences or feel guilty about them, but you do have to\nwork with them. A person who scores lower on conscientiousness, for example,\nwill be less likely to be orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on\nenvironment design to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the less\nconscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy we discussed\nin Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality.*\nPeople can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, but if you prefer rock\nclimbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around your\ninterests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you find that low-fat works\nfor you, then more power to you. If you want to read more, don’t be embarrassed\nif you prefer steamy romance novels over nonfiction. Read whatever fascinates\nyou.* You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the\nhabit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find\nit. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the core idea\nbehind the 4th Law.\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is not the end\nof the story. Let’s turn our attention to finding and designing situations where\nyou’re at a natural advantage.\n\nHOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for\nmaintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost\nanything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to\nyou. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at\nthat task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because\nthey are making progress where others have failed, and because they get\nrewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them\nhappier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a\nvirtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a\nstruggle.\nHow do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we covered in the\n3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it\nsimply means they picked a habit that was too difficult. When a habit is easy,\nyou are more likely to be successful. When you are successful, you are more\nlikely to feel satisfied. However, there is another level to consider. In the long-\nrun, if you continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging.\nAt some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your\nskillset. How do you figure that out?\nThe most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem\nwith this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date\nevery eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an\neffective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit\ntrade-off.\nIn the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In\nrelationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business,\nit’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad\nrange of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution\nyou’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance\ndepends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you\nexploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore,\nexplore, explore.\nIn the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems\nto deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring\nwith the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend\n80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of",

If you have\na lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes more\nsense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good\namount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on\nthe deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found\nso far and get some results.\nAs you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask\nyourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most\nsatisfying to you:\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you\nare made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle\nthe pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying\nyourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less\nthan it hurts others is the work you were made to do.\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter\nwhen you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades\naway. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and\nperformers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible\nto experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some\ndegree.\nWhere do I get greater returns than the average person? We are\ncontinually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more\nlikely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started\nwriting at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite\nsure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming\nfaster for me than for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep\nwriting.\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have\nbeen taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of\nyou. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I\n\nfelt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or\npeople-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of\nengagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you\nare headed in the right direction.\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El\nGuerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued\nby society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities. We all\nhave limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who\nnot only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities\nthat favor us.\nBut what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?\nIf you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one.\nScott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few\nareas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can\ndraw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier\nthan the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than\nmost people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the\ncombination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my\nbusiness background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to\nunderstand without living it.”\nWhen you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By\ncombining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it\neasier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the\ngame everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors\ntheir strengths and avoids their weaknesses.\nIn college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a combination\nof physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart enough to stand out\namong the top physics or biology majors, so I created my own game. And\nbecause it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was interested in—\nstudying felt like less of a chore. It was also easier to avoid the trap of\ncomparing myself to everyone else. After all, nobody else was taking the same\ncombination of classes, so who could say if they were better or worse?\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics.\nThe more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete\nwith you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm wrestler, but\neven a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm wrestling because the arm wrestling",

We know which types of opportunities to look for and\nwhich types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the\nbetter our strategy can be.\nBiological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on\nwhether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to\nsomeone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has\nnothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities.\nPeople get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the\neffort required to get close to them.\nFurthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work.\nYes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you\nhaven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a\nbetter or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t\nexplain away their success as luck.\nIn summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over\nthe long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.\nWork hard on the things that come easy.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right\nfield of competition.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life\nis a struggle.\nGenes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful\nadvantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in\nunfavorable circumstances.\nHabits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose\nthe habits that best suit you.\nPlay a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that\nfavors you, create one.\nGenes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They\ntell us what to work hard on.\n\n19\nThe Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in\nLife and Work\nIN 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old\nboy walked in and asked for a job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy\nmanaged to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.\nWithin a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned\ntricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and tried out\nsimple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not\nperforming magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming a\ncomedian.\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around\nLos Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was rarely on\nstage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy\ndrinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered\nhis standup routine to an empty club.\nIt wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His\nfirst routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his material\nhad expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later, a ten-minute\nshow. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He\nhad to read three poems during the show just to make the routine long enough,\nbut his skills continued to progress.\nHe spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He took a\njob as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land his own appearances\non talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being a regular\nguest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.\nFinally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to fame. He\ntoured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities in eighty days.\nThen eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one show in",

      "content": "Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in New York. He\ncatapulted to the top of his genre and became one of the most successful\ncomedians of his time.\nHis name is Steve Martin.\nMartin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to stick with\nhabits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is hard to imagine a\nsituation that would strike fear into the hearts of more people than performing\nalone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this\nfear every week for eighteen years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4\nyears spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.”\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—whether\npracticing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while most of us\nstruggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather than\nones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for many years.\nWhile there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the\nway to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks\nof “just manageable difficulty.”\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of\ndifficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-\nold, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In\ncontrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena\nWilliams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the game\nprogresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good chance of\nwinning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away,\nand you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of\njust manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when\nworking on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too\nhard. Not too easy. Just right.\nTHE GOLDILOCKS RULE\n\nway, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of\njust manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems\ncrucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for\nchallenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress\nto stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay\nattractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps\nthe greatest villain on the quest for selfimprovement.\nHOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON\nYOUR GOALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined a\nweightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had worked\nwith thousands of athletes during his long career, including a few Olympians. I\nintroduced myself and we began talking about the process of improvement.\n“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked.\n“What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he\nsaid something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can\nhandle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and\nover.”\nHis answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work\nethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s\nbusiness or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to\npassion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed\nwhen we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have\nsome bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really\nsuccessful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The\ndifference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of\nboredom.\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more\nboring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we\nlearn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster\nthan that. All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a\ncouple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much.\nThings are going well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in\na good place.",

      "content": "The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with\nhabits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as\nour habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.\nPerhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one\nworkout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon\nas we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy\n—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire\nnovelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as\nmuch as those who are doing badly.”\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that\nprovide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn\nprovides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these\nexperiences offer continual elements of surprise.\nIn psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines are the\nmost common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and\nthen but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This\nvariance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and\naccelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward\npeople are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will\nchange their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we\nalready experience because they reduce boredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure.\nHalf of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need\njust enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to\nexperience desire. This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If\nyou’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable\ndifficulty is a good way to keep things interesting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t\nwant them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I\nwould switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my\ntrips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer. And if I flossed my teeth\neach night and only sometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point,\neveryone faces the same challenge on the journey of selfimprovement: you have\nto fall in love with boredom.\nWe all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would\n\nconsistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\nI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there\nwill be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be\ndays when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be\nsets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days\nthat you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or\ndraining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and\nan amateur.\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nProfessionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose;\namateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.\nDavid Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to\navoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fair-\nweather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything. When a habit\nis truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.\nProfessionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy\nit, but they find a way to put the reps in.\nThere have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but I’ve never\nregretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like\nwriting, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of\ndays I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on\nsomething that was important to me.\nThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the\nsame thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation\nwhen working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current\nabilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting and less\nsatisfying.

In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the\npieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the\ngame. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space\nfor more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the\nsimple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are\nfree to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the\nbackbone of any pursuit of excellence.\nHowever, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition\ndevelops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you\nbecome less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes\neasier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you\nstop thinking about how to do it better.\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside\nof habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying\nattention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re\ngaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—\nnot improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been\nmastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.\nUsually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You don’t need\na system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie your\nshoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good enough is\nusually good enough. The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you\ncan spend it on what really matters.\nHowever, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels\nof performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same\nthings blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not\nsufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and\n\ndeliberate practice.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nTo become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. Basketball\nplayers need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on to\nmastering layups with their nondominant hand. Surgeons need to repeat the first\nincision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed, so that they\ncan focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery. But after one\nhabit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and\nbegin building the next habit.\nMastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success,\nrepeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as\nthe foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks\nbecome easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because\nnow you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the\nnext level of performance. It’s an endless cycle.\nMASTERING ONE HABIT\nMASTERING A FIELD\n\n\nFIGURE 16: The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been\nreached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.\nAlthough habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of\nyour performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is\nprecisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—\nright when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming\ncomfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.\nThe solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.\nHOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball teams\never assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way. The team started the\n1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “The pundits were\nsaying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,” head coach\nPat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986\nplayoffs and suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe “best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA\nchampionship.\nAfter that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players\nhad and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to see flashes of\nbrilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to",

      "content": "play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a\nplan to do exactly that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or\nCBE.\n“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their\nbasketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking Their\nNumber. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him\ninto our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and then\nimprove upon his averages.”\nAfter determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key\nstep. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the\ncourse of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best\nEffort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we discussed in Chapter 1, the\nLakers sought peak performance by getting slightly better each day.\nRiley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or\nstatistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and\nphysically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you when\nyou know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls, going\nafter rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a teammate\nwhen the player he’s guarding has surged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’\ndeeds.”\nAs an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at the\ntime—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game.\nMagic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose ball (+1).\nFinally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.\nThe positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract\nthe 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.\n29/33 = 0.879\nMagic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for all\nof a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to\nimprove by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each player’s current\nCBE to not only their past performances but also those of other players in the\nleague. As Riley put it, “We rank team members alongside league opponents\nwho play the same position and have similar role definitions.”\nSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top performers in\nthe league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and measured them\n\nagainst the corresponding players on his own roster. Solid, reliable players\ngenerally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic\nJohnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over\n1,000.”\nThe Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical\ncomparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November\n1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing\nbetter or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how\ntheir performance figures for December 1986, stacked up against November’s.”\nThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they were\nNBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as\nthe Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA\nchampionships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining an effort is the most important\nthing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things\nright, then do them the same way every time.”\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and review.\nThe Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out of what\nthey had, and made sure their habits improved rather than declined.\nReflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits\nbecause it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible\npaths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create\nrationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining\nwhether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.\nTop performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review,\nand the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is\none of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medalist. He\nstill takes notes after every practice in which he reviews his training for the day\nand searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer\nKatie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on\nher nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by other\nswimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds his\nthoughts.\nIt’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparing fresh\nmaterial, he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of times and test\nhundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records which bits go over\nwell and where he needs to make adjustments. The few killer lines that survive\nwill form the backbone of his new show.\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which",

They review their choices at the end of each\nmonth or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.*\nImprovement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them.\nReflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and\nmake course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley adjusting the effort\nof his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it\nbecomes ineffective.\nPersonally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each\nDecember, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I\ntally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how\nmany workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I\nreflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions:\n1. \nWhat went well this year?\n2. \nWhat didn’t go so well this year?\n3. \nWhat did I learn?\nSix months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report.\nLike everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize\nwhere I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to\nrevisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance\nwith them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward\nbeing the type of person I wish to become.*\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\n1. \nWhat are the core values that drive my life and work?\n2. \nHow am I living and working with integrity right now?\n3. \nHow can I set a higher standard in the future?\nThese two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but they\nare crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens\nwhen I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my\ndesired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of\nperson I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on\nnew challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the\nfundamentals.\n\nReflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful\nbecause of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice\nis like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every\nimperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback.\nConversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You\naren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your\nteeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing\nyourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important\nchanges you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to\nview the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.\nFinally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most\nimportant aspects of behavior change: identity.\nHOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK\nIn the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your\ndesired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same\nbeliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against\nyou, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your\nweak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest\ndownsides of building habits.\nThe more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our\nidentity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in\nevery industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and\nsticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is\ncommitted to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of\nher younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and\nthen gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes\nto grow beyond it.\nOne solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an\noverwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham,\n“keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less\ncapable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie everything up in\nbeing the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of\nthat facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a\nhealth condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis\non your hands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.\nLose that one thing and you lose yourself.",

For many business owners, their identity is\nsomething along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have\nspent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after\nyou sell the company?\nThe key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that\nyou get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role\nchanges.\n“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally\ntough and loves a physical challenge.”\n“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is\ndisciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”\n“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and\ncreates things.”\nWhen chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like\nwater flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing\ncircumstances rather than against them.\nThe following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly:\nMen are born soft and supple;\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\nPlants are born tender and pliant;\ndead, they are brittle and dry.\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\nis a disciple of death.\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life.\nThe hard and stiff will be broken.\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\n\n\n—LAO TZU\nHabits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us\ninto our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is\nshifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so\nyou need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still\nserving you.\nA lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.\n\n\nChapter Summary\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The\ndownside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nReflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious\nof your performance over time.\nThe tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow\nbeyond it.\n\nChapter Summary\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking.

One\nformulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If\nyou give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich.\nBut what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point, you\nwill have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her\nso.\nWe can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change transform your\nlife? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another? And\nanother? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your life was\ntransformed by one small change.\nThe holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a\nthousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a\nfundamental unit of the overall system.\nIn the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless because\nthey get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin won’t make\nyou rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page\neach day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference.\nGradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one\nanother, the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a grain\nof sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your favor.\nEventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier\nto stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather\nthan against you.\nOver the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about top\nperformers. We’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists,\nbusiness leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star comedians who have all used the\nscience of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.\nEach of the people, teams, and companies we have covered has faced different\ncircumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way: through a\ncommitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.",

In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re having\ntrouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system.\nBad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to\nchange, but because you have the wrong system for change.”\nAs this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the Four Laws\nof Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you can use to\nbuild better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be hard to\nremember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like\nstarting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a\nhabit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you\nwon’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.\n \nBehaviors are effortless here. Behaviors are difficult here.\nObvious\nInvisible\nAttractive\nUnattractive\nEasy\nHard\nSatisfying\nUnsatisfying\nYou want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the\nright side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.\nThis is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent\nsolution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four\nLaws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious.\nMake it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always\nlooking for the next way to get 1 percent better.\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.\nIt’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the\nbusiness you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you\ncan build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build\nif you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t\nstop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop\ncaring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.\nThat’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nAppendix\n\n\nWhat Should You Read Next?\nTHANK YOU SO much for taking the time to read this book. It has been a pleasure\nsharing my work with you. If you are looking for something to read next, allow\nme to offer a suggestion.\nIf you enjoyed Atomic Habits, then you may like my other writing as well. My\nlatest articles are sent out in my free weekly newsletter. Subscribers are also the\nfirst to hear about my newest books and projects.

This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits\nbut also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nIn this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common\nsense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to\nclarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing\nhuman behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it\neverywhere.\nAwareness comes before desire. A craving is created when you assign\nmeaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your\ncurrent situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed\nan opportunity.\nHappiness is simply the absence of desire. When you observe a cue, but do\nnot desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation.\nHappiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction),\nbut about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently.\nHappiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.\nHowever, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As\nCaed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and\na new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a\nchange in state and getting it.\nIt is the idea of pleasure that we chase. We seek the image of pleasure that\nwe generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be",

      "content": "like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction\nonly comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant\nwhen he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued.\nPleasure ensues from action.\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. The\nfirst step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information,\nan event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.\nCraving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the\nrealization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running\nrampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a\nproblem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.\nWith a big enough why you can overcome any how. Friedrich Nietzsche,\nthe German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live\nfor can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about\nhuman behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are\nyou are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving\ncan power great action—even when friction is high.\nBeing curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious\ncounts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will\nnever deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not\nintelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing\nanything is first cultivating a desire for it.”\nEmotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some\nlevel. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel\ncompelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to\nemotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still\nwill not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why\ncraving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.\nWe can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The\nprimary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first\nresponse—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling\nand anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain\n—is the part that does the “thinking.”\nPsychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus\nSystem 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality\nonly intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but\n\ncan notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run\nthose facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why\nappealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a\ntopic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data.\nThis is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making.\nPut another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one\nthat benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation\nfrom a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the\ndata rather than the emotion.\nSuffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a\nchange in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your\nstate is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity\nto seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level.\nWith craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied\nbut lack ambition.\nYour actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying\nsomething is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s\ntime to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true\nmotivations.\nReward is on the other side of sacrifice. Response (sacrifice of energy)\nalways precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only\ncomes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.\nSelf-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. A reward is an outcome\nthat satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting\nour desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy\nyour craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-\ncontrol requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.\nOur expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap between our cravings\nand our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the\nmismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight),\nthen we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is\nnegative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.\nFor example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you\nexpect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes\nyour satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a\ndisappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a",

      "content": "Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having\ntoo little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be\nunsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the\nsolution.\nHappiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took\nme three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I\ntold my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A\nfew years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day.\nAnd yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results\nninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t\nuntil a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating\nsomething that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.\nThe pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation. When desire is\nhigh, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts\nmore than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first\nplace. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”\nFeelings come both before and after the behavior. Before acting, there is a\nfeeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a feeling\nthat teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.\nCue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\nHow we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.\nDesire initiates. Pleasure sustains. Wanting and liking are the two drivers of\nbehavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are\nwhat initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it.\nPleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you\nto act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.\nHope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. The first\ntime an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation\n(cravings) is based solely on promise. The second time around, your expectation\nis grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your\nhope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the\nlikely outcome.\nThis is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or\n\nAcknowledgments\nI HAVE RELIED HEAVILY on others during the creation of this book. Before anyone else, I\nmust thank my wife, Kristy, who has been indispensable throughout this process.\nShe has played every role a person can play in the writing of a book: spouse,\nfriend, fan, critic, editor, researcher, therapist. It is no exaggeration to say this\nbook would not be the same without her. It might not exist at all. Like\neverything in our life, we did it together.\nSecond, I am grateful to my family, not only for their support and\nencouragement on this book but also for believing in me no matter what project I\nhappen to be working on. I have benefited from many years of support from my\nparents, grandparents, and siblings. In particular, I want my mom and dad to\nknow that I love them. It is a special feeling to know that your parents are your\ngreatest fans.\nThird, to my assistant, Lyndsey Nuckols. At this point, her job defies\ndescription as she has been asked to do nearly everything one could imagine for\na small business. Thankfully, her skills and talents are more powerful than my\nquestionable management style. Some sections of this book are as much hers as\nthey are mine. I am deeply grateful for her help.\nAs for the content and writing of the book, I have a long list of people to\nthank. To start, there are a few people from whom I have learned so much that it\nwould be a crime to not mention them by name. Leo Babauta, Charles Duhigg,\nNir Eyal, and BJ Fogg have each influenced my thoughts on habits in\nmeaningful ways. Their work and ideas can be found sprinkled throughout this\ntext. If you enjoyed this book, I’d encourage you to read their writing as well.\nAt various stages of writing, I benefited from the guidance of many fine\neditors. Thanks to Peter Guzzardi for walking me through the early stages of the\nwriting process and for a kick in the pants when I really needed it. I am indebted\nto Blake Atwood and Robin Dellabough for transforming my ugly and insanely\nlong first drafts into a tight, readable manuscript. And I am thankful to Anne\nBarngrover for her ability to add a little class and poetic style to my writing.\nI’d like to thank the many people who read early versions of the manuscript,\nincluding Bruce Ammons, Darcey Ansell, Tim Ballard, Vishal Bhardwaj,\nCharlotte Blank, Jerome Burt, Sim Campbell, Al Carlos, Nicky Case, Julie\nChang, Jason Collins, Debra Croy, Roger Dooley, Tiago Forte, Matt Gartland,",

It’s probably a paraphrase of this passage: “The psychological\nrule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner\nopposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.” For more, see C.

In 1954, James Olds and Peter Milner, two neuroscientists at McGill University, decided to implant an\nelectrode deep into the center of a rat’s brain. The precise placement of the electrode was largely happenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind remained a mystery. But Olds and\nMilner got lucky. They inserted the needle right next to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a piece of chocolate cake,\nor listen to a favorite pop song, or watch your favorite team win the World Series, it is your NAcc that helps you feel so happy. But Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too much\npleasure can be fatal. They placed the electrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran a small current into each wire, making the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed that the\nrodents lost interest in everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship behavior ceased. The rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages, transfixed by their bliss. Within\ndays, all of the animals had perished. They died of thirst.

In an email conversation with Orland on October 18, 2016, he\nexplained the origins of the story. “Yes, the ‘ceramics story’ in ‘Art & Fear’ is indeed true, allowing for some literary license in the retelling. Its real-world origin was as a gambit employed\nby photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at the University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art & Fear’ it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me\n—except I replaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored. Admittedly, it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art medium being discussed, but David\nBayles (co-author) & I are both photographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to broaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing thing to me\nis that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the moral of the story appears to hold equally true straight across the whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that matter).”\nLater in that same email, Orland said, “You have our permission to reprint any or all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on publishing an adapted\nversion, which combines their telling of the ceramics story with facts from the original source of Uelsmann’s photography students.

The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like\nhappiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s\nsurrender to a person other than oneself.” For more, see Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962).\n“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”: Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Levy, The Twilight of the Idols (Edinburgh: Foulis, 1909).\nThe feeling comes first (System 1): Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2015).\nappealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason: “If you wish to persuade, appeal to interest, rather than reason” (Benjamin Franklin).\nSatisfaction = Liking − Wanting: This is similar to David Meister’s fifth law of service businesses: Satisfaction = perception − expectation.\n“Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more”: Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Anna Lydia Motto, Moral Epistles (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985).\nAs Aristotle noted: It is debated whether Aristotle actually said this. The quote has been attributed to him for centuries, but I could find no primary source for the phrase.",

You can see my thoughts at atomichabits.com/cycling.\n \n* I geeked out and actually calculated this. Washington, D.C., is about 225 miles\nfrom New York City. Assuming you are flying on a 747 or an Airbus A380,\nchanging the heading by 3.5 degrees as you leave Los Angeles likely causes the\nnose of the airplane to shift between 7.2 to 7.6 feet, or about 86 to 92 inches. A\nvery small shift in direction can lead to a very meaningful change in destination.\n\n\n* The terms unconscious, nonconscious, and subconscious can all be used to\ndescribe the absence of awareness or thought. Even in academic circles, these\nwords are often used interchangeably without much nitpicking (for once).\nNonconscious is the term I’m going to use because it is broad enough to\nencompass both the processes of the mind we could never consciously access\nand the moments when we are simply not paying attention to what surrounds us.\nNonconscious is a description of anything you are not consciously thinking\nabout.\n \n* Certainly, there are some aspects of your identity that tend to remain\nunchanged over time—like identifying as someone who is tall or short. But even\nfor more fixed qualities and characteristics, whether you view them in a positive\nor negative light is determined by your experiences throughout life.\n\n\n* Readers of The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg will recognize these terms.\nDuhigg wrote a great book and my intention is to pick up where he left off by\nintegrating these stages into four simple laws you can apply to build better habits\nin life and work.\n \n* Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special recognition for their influence on\nthis image. This representation of the habit loop is a combination of language\nthat was popularized by Duhigg’s book, The Power of Habit, and a design that\nwas popularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked.",

Her young son\nstepped onto the Shinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that travel at\nover two hundred miles per hour, just as the doors were closing. She was left\noutside on the platform and jammed her arm through the door to grab him. With\nher arm stuck in the door, the train was about to take off, but right before it\npulled away an employee performed a safety check by Pointing-and-Calling up\nand down the platform. In less than five seconds, he noticed the woman and\nmanaged to stop the train from leaving. The door opened, the woman—now in\ntears—ran to her son, and a minute later the train departed safely.\n \n* Interested readers can get a template to create their own Habits Scorecard at\natomichabits.com/scorecard.\n\n\n* In addition to her payment for the library, Catherine the Great asked Diderot to\nkeep the books until she needed them and offered to pay him a yearly salary to\nact as her librarian.\n \n* Fogg refers to this strategy as the “Tiny Habits recipe,” but I'll call it the habit\nstacking formula throughout the book.\n\n\n* If you’re looking for more examples and guidance, you can download a Habit\nStacking template at atomichabits.com/habitstacking.\n \n* Dopamine is not the only chemical that influences your habits. Every behavior\ninvolves multiple brain regions and neurochemicals, and anyone who claims that\n“habits are all about dopamine” is skipping over major portions of the process. It\nis just one of the important role players in habit formation. However, I will\nsingle out the dopamine circuit in this chapter because it provides a window into\nthe biological underpinnings of desire, craving, and motivation that are behind\nevery habit.\n\n\n* I’m so happy I was able to fit a Game of Thrones reference into this book.\n \n* This is just a partial list of underlying motives.

It has been adapted here with permission. See the endnotes for a full\nexplanation.\n \n* This is a foundational principle in physics, where it is known as the Principle\nof Least Action. It states that the path followed between any two points will\nalways be the path requiring the least energy. This simple principle underpins\nthe laws of the universe. From this one idea, you can describe the laws of motion\nand relativity.\n\n\n* The phrase addition by subtraction is also used by teams and businesses to\ndescribe removing people from a group in order to make the team stronger\noverall.\n \n* To be fair, this still sounds like an amazing night.\n\n\n* I designed a habit journal specifically to make journaling easier. It includes a\n“One Line Per Day” section where you simply write one sentence about your\nday. You can learn more at atomichabits.com/journal.\n \n* The irony of how closely this story matches my process of writing this book is\nnot lost on me. Although my publisher was much more accommodating, and my\ncloset remained full, I did feel like I had to place myself on house arrest to finish\nthe manuscript.\n\n\n* This is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses contract.” Named\nafter Ulysses, the hero of The Odyssey, who told his sailors to tie him to the mast\nof the ship so that he could hear the enchanting song of the Sirens but wouldn’t\nbe able to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks. Ulysses realized the\nbenefits of locking in your future actions while your mind is in the right place\nrather than waiting to see where your desires take you in the moment.\n\n\n* The shift to a delayed-return environment likely began around the advent of\nagriculture ten thousand years ago when farmers began planting crops in\nanticipation of a harvest months later. However, it was not until recent centuries\nthat our lives became filled with delayed-return choices: career planning,\nretirement planning, vacation planning, and everything else that occupies our\ncalendars.\n \n* Time inconsistency is also referred to as hyperbolic discounting.",

The brain overestimates the\ndanger of anything that seems like an immediate threat but has almost no\nlikelihood of actually occurring: your plane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a\nburglar breaking in while you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the bus\nyou’re on. Meanwhile, it underestimates what appears to be a distant threat but is\nactually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat from eating unhealthy food,\nthe gradual decay of your muscles from sitting at a desk, the slow creep of\nclutter when you fail to tidy up.\n \n* \nInterested \nreaders \ncan \nfind \na \nhabit \ntracker \ntemplate \nat\natomichabits.com/tracker.\n\n\n* You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by Bryan Harris and get a blank\ntemplate at atomichabits.com/contract.\n \n* If you are interested in taking a personality test, you can find links to the most\nreliable tests here: atomichabits.com/personality.\n\n\n* If it’s Harry Potter on repeat, I feel you.\n \n* I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a flow state. This\nisn’t confirmed. It’s just my guess. Psychologists commonly refer to the brain as\noperating in two modes: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast and instinctual.\nGenerally speaking, processes you can perform very quickly (like habits) are\ngoverned by System 1. Meanwhile, System 2 controls thinking processes that are\nmore effortful and slow—like calculating the answer to a difficult math problem.\nWith regard to flow, I like to imagine System 1 and System 2 as residing on\nopposite ends of the spectrum of thinking. The more automatic a cognitive\nprocess is, the more it slides toward the System 1 side of the spectrum. The more\neffortful a task is, the more it slides toward System 2. Flow, I believe, resides on\nthe razor’s edge between System 1 and System 2. You are fully using all of your\nautomatic and implicit knowledge related to the task while also working hard to\nrise to a challenge beyond your ability. Both brain modes are fully engaged. The\nconscious and nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.",
